       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='PREFACE \\nThis book is not simply for people who love the intellectual challenge of \\nsolving problems. It is also for people who dislike problem solving or who \\nfeel intimidated by problems. And it is for people who want to help \\nothers solve problems. For example, many parents may find this book \\nuseful for helping their children perform better in school. Business lead\\xad\\ners who recognize the importance of skills that enable their employees to \\nidentify and solve potential problems may also find this book useful. In \\naddition, we believe that this book can provide a helpful tool for edu\\xad\\ncators and researchers. For example, we have tried to illustrate how \\nknowledge acquisition and knowledge production activities such as class\\xad\\nroom teaching and scientific research are instances of problem solving . \\nBy becoming more aware of the processes used to solve problems, people \\ncan improve their learning and their abilities to use knowledge to solve \\nnew problems that they face. \\nWe do not claim that this book will dramatically increase your IQ, \\nmake you wealthy, or free you from all personal problems. However, \\nbased on our work with high school. college, and even graduate students, \\nand with teachers, administrators, and business leaders, we are confident \\nthat you will find something of value that you can use for the rest of your \\nlife . It has been our experience that different people find different parts of \\nthe book valuable, probably because people have different strengths and \\nweaknesses with respect to problem solving . Nevertheless, we have not \\nyet met anyone who felt that they learned nothing from this book. \\nWe believe that this second edition of The IDEAL Problem Solver \\nrepresents a significant advance over the first edition . In talking and \\nworking with people who have used the first edition, we have had the \\nopportunity to focus on the final component of IDEAL: looking at the \\neffects of our earlier efforts and learning from them. \\nWe thank the hundreds of people who have given us feedback. \\nSome have shown us how they have creatively applied the IDEAL frame\\xad\\nwork to problems such as enhancing their professional growth, improv-'),\n",

They have used \\nIDEAL in creative ways that we never imagined and that have taught us \\na great deal. Others have helped us see the need to clarify the IDEAL \\nframework. \\nIn this edition we have modified the framework to make it easier to \\nunderstand and apply. For example, we have modified both the \"define \\nproblems\" and the \"act on strategies\" components of the original IDEAL \\nframework. The changes take into account the fact that the way we \\ndefine our problem -solving goals affects our perception of problems and \\nconstrains the types of strategies we explore. They also reflect the impor\\xad\\ntance of anticipating the outcome of particular strategies before they are \\nfully implemented. The new edition includes many new examples and \\nexercises that will make it easier to understand and apply the IDEAL \\nframework. Finally, we have added a new chapter that explores strategies \\nfor improving how schools and organizations prepare people to think and \\nsolve problems. \\nThis edition has benefited from the efforts of hundreds of dedicated \\nresearchers in human thinking and problem solving . Thanks to them, we \\nnow have a better understanding of the nature of problem solving than \\nwe had before. We have tried to keep this book as \"user oriented\" as \\npossible, and hence we do not spend a great deal of time discussing the \\nscholarly literature on problem solving. Nevertheless, this literature has \\nhad a profound effect on our thinking, and we are grateful to all of the \\npeople who contribute to it. \\nIt is impossible to thank everyone for the contributions they have \\nmade to this book. However, some people have had such a long-term, \\nfundamental impact on our thinking that they deserve special mention . \\nThese include Jeff Franks, Jim Jenkins, Bob Shaw, and Walter Weimer. \\nRick Barclay, Marcia Johnson, and Nancy McCarrell have also made \\nsignificant contributions to our development. Others who have made \\nmajor contributions include Ruth Arbitman-Smith, Ann Brown, Joe \\nCampione, Keith Clayton, Reuven Feuerstein, Carl Haywood, and Mil\\xad\\ndred Hoffman . Nevertheless, none of these people should be held respon\\xad\\nsible for any of our mistakes. \\nSome of the people who have played especially strong roles in \\nguiding our thinking for this edition are Linda Barron, Bill Corbin, Jim \\nDickinson, Linda Giesbrecht-Bettoli, Laura Goin, Elizabeth Goldman, Su\\xad\\nsan Goldman, Bob Harwood, Ted Hasselbring, Richard Johnson, Charles \\nKinzer, Alison Moore, Jim Pellegrino, John Pigg, Victoria Risko, Deborah \\nRowe, Diana Miller Sharp, Robert Sherwood, Richard Troelstrup, Jim '),\n",

These include Lea Adams, Pam Auble, Sue Burns, \\nDavid Chattin, Vic Delclos, Jon Doner, Joan Littlefield, Karen Mezynski, \\nDon Morris, Greg Perfetto, and Nancy Vye. Reviews of this book by \\nBunny Bransford, Wesley Henry, Joy Henshall, Richard Mayer, Thomas \\nMosley, and Robert Sternberg have also been very helpful. In addition, \\nwe are grateful to the many students at Tennessee Technological Univer\\xad\\nsity and Vanderbilt University who have participated in our courses on \\nproblem solving and provided us with feedback. \\nWe are especially grateful to members of our familes who have been \\ninstrumental in helping us prepare this second edition. We thank Bunny \\nBransford, Jason Bransford, Ashley Bransford, Camille Bransford, Ada \\nHaynes, and Michael Stein for all their help.

If you think of \\nan ideal problem solver as someone who always knows or can immedi\\xad\\nately derive the answer to every problem, then the answer is no, we are \\nnot ideal problem solvers. As you read this book, however, you will see \\nthat our ideal problem solver is someone who continually attempts to \\nimprove by paying attention to his or her processes and by learning from \\nany mistakes that are made. It is this commitment toward becoming an \\nideal problem solver-toward continuing to learn each day-that we \\nendorse and try to live by. We find that it is an exciting commitment \\nbecause we learn something new almost every day. \\nIt is our hope that you too will find it valuable to think about your \\nown problem-solving processes and that, by analyzing them, you will \\nenjoy the continual challenge of discovering ways that they can be im\\xad\\nproved. And as you make discoveries and observations, we would love to \\nhear from you. Your ideas will help us continue to learn . \\nJohn D. Bransford \\nBarry S. Stein \\nJanuary 1993 '),\n",

The president and spedal members of \\nthe Executive Committee of the National Security Coundl met in an \\nemergency session . Information had just been obtained that the Soviet \\nUnion was in the process of building missile-launching bases in Cuba. \\nThe missiles were capable of carrying nuclear warheads that could \\ndestroy most major dties in the Western Hemisphere. During six days of \\nsecret meetings, these men had to develop a plan that would remove or \\ndestroy the missile bases before they became operational . \\nSeveral different plans were considered and evaluated. One plan \\ncalled for an air strike that would quickly destroy all the missile in\\xad\\nstallations. Another called for a naval blockade that might then be \\nfollowed by an air strike or invasion if the missile bases were not volun\\xad\\ntarily removed . After the blockade plan was selected, the president \\nmade a televised speech in which he conveyed details of the crisis to the \\nnation and explained the immediate course of action that would be \\ntaken. \\nMany historians consider the Cuban missile crisis the closest the \\nworld has come to an all-out nuclear war . Had these men selected a dif\\xad\\nferent course of action for the problem they confronted, the world as we \\nknow it might have changed drastically. In any case, we, the people of \\nthe world, would have had to live with the solution they formulated, \\nfor better or for worse. Such historical events dramatically illustrate the \\nsignificance of problem-solving skills. 1 '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='- The Ideal Problem Solver \\nIt is instructive to stop and think about the many ways in which our lives \\nare influenced by attempts to solve problems . We studied problem solv\\xad\\ning for some time before we began to appreciate the following point, \\nwhich now seems obvious: Our lives are influenced tremendously by the \\nsolutions to problems that were proposed and implemented by people \\nwho preceded us in history . Solutions to problems such as the Cuban \\nmissile crisis and polio stand out as prime examples. However, many \\nmore solutions proposed by others have had an even greater impact on \\nour daily lives. For example, you may not think of such things as stop \\nsigns, traffic signals, or rules about which side of the road to drive · on as \\nsolutions to problems, but they are. Many of them were originated by \\nWilliam Eno, often called the father of traffic safety . Eno, who was born \\nin New York City in 1858, became concerned about the problem of \\nmassive traffic jams (involving horse-drawn vehicles) caused by the ab\\xad\\nsence of traffic regulations. Eno published an article entitled \"Reform \\nin Our Street Traffic Urgently Needed\" and thereby focused people\\'s at\\xad\\ntention on an important problem . He also proposed solutions for this \\nproblem, such as stop signs, one - way streets, and pedestrian safety is\\xad\\nlands-ideas we take for granted today. \\nLaws and rules represent only a small part of our everyday lives that \\nare affected by other people\\'s solutions to problems. Such artifacts as \\nfurniture, clothing, tools, and appliances are also the result of attempts to \\nsolve problems. Even our language and number systems are inventions \\nthat allow people to solve problems. Imagine the difficulties we would \\nexperience if we did not have a language for expressing our ideas, or if \\nwe had only a spoken language but no system for producing and inter\\xad\\npreting written language . Number systems are equally important . These \\ninventions make it possible to solve a variety of problems that otherwise \\nmight be impossible or at least very difficult to solve. \\nMany of our solutions create new problems of their own. Cars \\nincrease the probability of pollution ; advances in physics can increase the \\npotential for menacing weapons; medical breakthroughs often raise new \\nethical dilemmas about life and death; new inventions like computers \\nplace new demands on people\\'s ability to learn. It seems that we will \\nalways need effective thinkers and problem solvers . Indeed, researchers \\nsuch as Lauren Resnick 2 and Ray Nickerson 3 argue that now more than \\never , increasingly rapid changes in society require citizens who can think, \\nreason, and solve problems on their own . In modern factories, for ex\\xad\\nample, managers want employees who can spot problems that have gone \\nunrecognized and do something about them. Many companies are at-'),\n",

We find that people\\'s \\nanswers to this question depend on their beliefs about the nature of \\nthinking and problem solving. We will discuss several important ideas \\nabout problem solving in the following paragraphs. \\nIs Problem-Solving Rbilit~ Determ ined b~ Intelligence? \\nMany people tend to equate the ability to solve problems with the \\ngeneral concept of intelligence. If they have received poor or average \\nscores on intelligence tests, they feel that they are poor or average prob\\xad\\nlem solvers as well. \\nDuring the past decade, researchers have developed a number of \\nimportant new ideas about the nature of intelligence and its relationship \\nto problem solving. An excellent example stems from the work of Ulrich \\nNeisser 4 who argued for the need to differentiate \"academic intelligence\" \\nfrom \"practical intelligence.\" Typical intelligence tests tend to predict how \\nwell people do in academic settings. High scores on such tests, however, \\nare no guarantee of successful everyday problem solving. You may have \\nmet someone who is very proficient academically but does quite poorly \\nat ordinary problem-solving tasks. \\nTheorists such as Richard Wagner and Robert Sternberg 5 have \\nbegun to explore in detail the concept of academic versus practical intel\\xad\\nligence. They find that typical intelligence tests do very poorly at predict\\xad\\ning real-world success, such as success in business. They have constructed \\ntests of practical intelligence that do a much better job of predicting \\npeople\\'s everyday success. Howard Gardner\\'s 6 work on multiple intel\\xad\\nligences also indicates the need to stop thinking about problem-solving \\nability as equivalent to scores on standard intelligence tests. \\nOne danger of believing that typical measures of intelligence can \\npredict success in thinking and problem solving is that these beliefs can \\nlead to self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, research by Carol Dweck 7 \\nindicates that people may avoid tasks in which they initially experience \\nfailure if they believe that intelligence is a fixed entity that someone \\neither has or doesn\\'t have. David Schwartz, 8 a business consultant, voices '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='- The Ideal Problem Solver \\na similar concern about self-fulfilling prophecies. He notes that one of the \\nmajor barriers that holds people back in business is their belief that they \\nare \"not smart enough.\" Schwartz argues quite strongly that factors other \\nthan intelligence test scores are much more important in determining \\nsuccess. \\nThe Importance of Specific Hnowledge \\nIn addition to identifying the need to expand our traditional ideas about \\nthe nature of intelligence, research conducted during the past two \\ndecades shows that problem-solving abilities often depend on specialized \\nknowledge in a discipline. Our ability to solve problems is not simply \\nequivalent to a set of general problem-solving skills. One implication of \\nthis conclusion is that the same individual may be both good and poor at \\nproblem solving, depending on the nature of the problem. A brain sur\\xad\\ngeon may be brilliant in the operating room but be unable to solve a \\nplumbing problem. \\nImagine the problem of looking at a chessboard that shows a game \\nafter 20 moves and predicting who is going to win and why . We made a \\nvideotape of two people attempting this task. One of them, James , was \\nvery good at predicting the winner and explaining his answer. The other, \\nRob, did quite poorly and could not analyze the situation in depth. People \\nwho see the videotape remark that it is easy to believe that one is simply \\nsmarter than the other . But in fact, both are successful individuals. Some\\xad\\nthing else is going on. \\nNow imagine another task. You are shown the code for a computer \\nprogram and are also shown that it does not do what it was supposed to \\ndo . The problem is to find the bug (error) in the program so that it can be \\nfixed. We have a videotape of the same two individuals trying to solve \\nthis problem, and once again, one does well and the other doesn\\'t. This \\ntime, however, it is Rob who does well and James who does poorly . \\nYou can probably guess the reason for the differences in James\\'s and \\nRob \\'s performance. James has spent literally thousands of hours playing \\nchess; Rob has spent only ten. Conversely, Rob has spent hundreds of \\nhours debugging computer programs written by his students, whereas \\nJames\\'s programming experience is much more limited. Overall, the \\nability of James and Rob to solve problems is strongly affected by the \\namount of experience they have had in particular areas. \\nMicheline Chi, Robert Glaser, and Marshall Farr note that re\\xad\\nsearchers in cognitive science have shown clearly that the ability to solve \\nproblems is strongly affected by the amount and organization of people\\'s '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='The Importance of Problem Solving .. \\nknowledge about an area (for example, chess, biology, sports, computers, \\nphysics, card games such as bridge). 9 Similarly, the ability to solve intel\\xad\\nlectual puzzles is strongly affected by people\\'s experience with these \\nkinds of problems. For example, if you work with puzzles like the ones \\nshown below, you gradually learn that there are tricks of the trade that \\ncan help you find solutions with relative ease (see Appendix A for \\nanswers). The same is true with the kinds of problems that are frequently \\nfound on intelligence tests (for example, verbal analogies such as \"doctor \\nis to hospital as mechanic is to \") . \\nSolve the three puzzles below. \\nG SGE \\nG ESG \\nS G EG \\nEC NA LG BAN ANA \\nThese observations are important because they illustrate the power\\xad\\nful effects that experience can have on problem solving, as well as the \\nlimitations of such expertise for solving problems in other domains. The \\nbeneficial effects of specialized knowledge are constrained by the prob\\xad\\nlem domain (for example, playing chess, computer progamming). The \\nbeneficial effects of specialized knowledge are also constrained by the \\ngoals we have in a particular problem domain. For example, in the pre\\xad\\nvious discussion we noted that James was very good at predicting the \\nwinners of chess games; we doubt, however, that his specialized \\nknowledge of chess would allow him to do any better than Rob if the goal \\nwere to determine whether the chess game was played by right- or \\nleft-handed players or to determine the age of the chess pieces. The \\ninteraction of these three variables (specialized knowledge, problem do\\xad\\nmain, and specific goals) in thinking and prob l em-solving tasks is il\\xad\\nlustrated in Figure l. The tetrahedral model of thinking (adapted from \\nJim Jenkins 10 ) also shows that the ability to use specialized knowledge to \\nsolve problems can be influenced by general thinking and problem-solv\\xad\\ning skills . We will discuss these general skills in Chapter 2, when we \\nexplore a model for improving thinking and problem solving. \\nRoutine Versus Non routine Problems \\nWhen thinking about problem-solving abilities (either your own or \\nothers\\'), it is important to distinguish between routine and nonroutine \\nproblems. A routine problem is one that is familiar to an individual \\nbecause it is similar to a problem that he or she has solved before. In '),\n",

Adapted from Jenkins \\n(1979). \\ncontrast, a nonroutine problem is novel and requires nevv thinking. The \\nimportant point is that any given problem may be relatively routine for one \\nperson and nonroutine for another. In general, it is much easier to solve \\nproblems that are routine than ones that are not. \\nConsider James and Rob, whom we discussed earlier. In chess, cer\\xad\\ntain board configurations and patterns of moves and countermoves are \\nclassics that are routine to chess experts like James but not to relative \\nnovices like Rob. Similarly, anyone who has taught computer program\\xad\\nming knows that there are routine patterns of bugs in student programs \\nthat are very likely to occur. Familiarity with these basic patterns makes \\nit much easier to spot bugs and correct them. \\nAn article in the magazine Dogfancy 11 illustrates the advantages of \\ndealing with routine problems. In the article, a dog owner writes that he \\ninstalled a dog door for his two dogs. One uses it all the time. The \\nyounger one (five years old) uses it to go out but will never use it to come \\nback in. What can he do? \\nThe dog expert, Bardi McLennan, began by asking whether the door \\noffers the dog the same angle of entrance from each side. She then stated, \\n\"One of my dogs alerted me to this one. When I placed a large flat stone \\nas a step outside the door, he was able to go through in both directions in \\nthe same body posture.\" Note that the pet owner\\'s problem reminded \\nMcLennan of a similar problem that she herself had encountered and '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='The Importance of Problem Solving -\\nsolved. As Roger Schank notes, these \"remindings\" of similar problems \\noften occur to experts and hence make their problem solving routine. 12 \\nMcLennan realized that the angle of entrance might not be the only \\nfeature that was responsible for the dog owner\\'s problem. Therefore, she \\nalso discussed other possible causes, such as that sunlight might be \\nreflected off the door from the outside and this might keep the dog from \\nentering, or that the flap of the door might have hit the younger dog in \\nthe face when it was following the older dog in from outside, making it \\nwary of the entrance. Overall, McLennan\\'s discussion of the possible \\ncauses of the problem, plus her suggested solutions, seemed to come from \\nher great deal of experience with dogs over her career. It is a good bet that \\nthis experience makes many of the problems she is asked to solve seem \\nrelatively routine. \\nWhenever you assess people\\'s problem-solving abilities (including \\nyour own), it is important to ask whether the problem is relatively \\nroutine or nonroutine for the particular problem solver. We say \"relative\\xad\\nly\" routine or nonroutine because most problems will fall somewhere in \\nbetween. The important point is that even people who are experts in a \\nparticular area often have to deal with nonroutine problems. Further\\xad\\nmore, they will not deal as efficiently with nonroutine problems as they \\nwill with problems that are routine for them. Problem-solving books like \\nthis one are designed to help people learn to deal with nonroutine prob\\xad\\nlems. Anyone who is involved in cutting-edge work needs skills for deal\\xad\\ning with the nonroutine. \\nOur Definition of Problem \\nThroughout this book, we will deal with problems that are probably \\nnonroutine for you. In fact, most theorists\\' definitions of \"problem\" as\\xad\\nsume that it is nonroutine. The definition that we will use is this: \"A \\nproblem exists when there is a discrepancy between an initial state and a \\ngoal state, and there is no ready-made solution for the problem so lver.\" \\nThe initial state is where you are as you begin the problem; the goal state \\nis where you want to end up when you solve it. The lack of a ready-made \\nsolution is illustrated by the maze shown in Figure 2. \\nI Some Common Approaches to Problems \\nA framework for dealing with nonroutine problems is discussed in the \\nnext chapter. For now, we emphasize the need to begin to pay attention '),\n",

When people begin to analyze their approaches to prob\\xad\\nlems, many discover that they often employ a \"let me out of here\" ap\\xad\\nproach when a problem seems difficult. At times like these there is a \\nnatural tendency to attempt to get out of the situation and do something \\nelse that is associated with a higher probability of success. \\nOver time, the let-me-out - of-here approach can result in self-fulfill\\xad\\ning prophecies.

Imagine that the right front turn signal on your car stops work\\xad\\ning. Try to figure out why it won\\'t work. For many people, the reaction \\nto this problem is \"I don\\'t know anything about cars.\" Therefore, they \\nassume that they cannot solve the problem. Once they are encouraged to \\nthink about the problem, however, they discover that they know more \\nthan they realized. For example, a turn signal presumably requires a \\nbulb, just as a lamp does. Similarly, both a lamp and a turn signa l un\\xad\\ndoubtedly require some power supply. The first step in diagnosing trouble \\nwith a turn signal, therefore, might be to ask whether the problem is \\ncaused by the bulb or the power supply. As a test, we could replace the \\nbulb on the right (the broken side) with the one from the left turn signal. \\nIf the good bulb still does not work, we could then consider possible \\nproblems with the power supply-for example, a fuse may have blown. \\nThe important point is that most people can do a relatively good job of \\nfiguring out why something like a turn signal is not working, if they think \\nabout the problem. \\nNegative reactions not only keep us from solving problems that we \\ncould solve but also can keep us from exploring new areas. For example, \\nwhile participating in a weekend workshop on sports psychology, a friend \\nof ours became aware of ways he was limiting himself unnecessarily. Part \\nof the workshop was spent competing with others in such events as \\nIndian wrestling, leg wrestling, and arm wrestling. A major goal of these \\nactivities was to help people explore their feelings about winning and \\nlosing. Since our friend was quite muscular, he won most of these events. \\nNevertheless, he felt sure that he was a humble winner; that is, he was \\nconfident that his ego would not have been shattered had he lost. \\nLater in the workshop the activities turned from more muscle\\xad\\noriented events (such as arm wrestling) to more coordination-oriented \\nevents. In particular, participants in the workshop were asked to learn a \\nnew type of intricate dance. As the dance instruction proceeded, our \\nfriend, who had always believed that he couldn\\'t dance, found that he \\nwas making many more errors than were others in the group (for ex\\xad\\nample, he kept turning the wrong way). \\nOur friend\\'s most important discovery was that he had a strong \\nreaction to his dilemma: \"This workshop has gotten ridiculous; I\\'m going \\nto leave.\" He almost did leave but was persuaded by the instructor to stay \\n(the instructor was watching for such reactions and knew how to deal \\nwith them). The instructor then recruited some volunteers to work with '),\n",

T he Id e al Problem S olver \\nour friend (and with several other individuals in a similar predicament) \\nuntil they had mastered the dance. According to our friend, this was a \\nvery significant experience. It made him realize that he had been avoid\\xad\\ning a number of situations because they were difficult at first. As a result \\nof his experience, our friend resolved to increase his \"courage span\" \\nwhen dealing with uncomfortable situations. Wertime 13 provides an ex\\xad\\ncellent discussion of the concept of courage spans. \\nI Mental Escapes \\nActually walking away from important problems is a relatively extreme \\nnegative approach to problem solving. In other cases, people may men\\xad\\ntally walk away without physically removing themselves. For example, \\npeople often think that they are diligently trying to complete tasks, yet \\nwhen prompted to stop and think about it, they realize that they have not \\nbeen attending to the problem to be solved. \\nConsider the activity of studying a text or one\\'s notes to prepare for \\na test. Most people have had the experience of going through the mo\\xad\\ntions of reading and suddenly realizing that nothing has registered; their \\nattention was directed somewhere other than toward the material to be \\nlearned. Similar difficulties can arise when listening to lectures. We begin \\nto think about something else and only later realize we missed what was \\nsaid. \\nJohn Holt 14 notes that attention can be an important factor in class\\xad\\nroom learning: \\nDuring many of the recitation classes, when the class supposedly is work\\xad\\ning as a unit, most of the children paid very little attention to what was \\ngoing on. Those who most needed to pay attention, usually paid the least. \\nThe kids who knew the answer to whatever question you were asking \\nwanted to make sure that you knew they knew, so their hands were \\nalways waving . ... But most of the time, when explaining, questioning, \\nor discussing what was going on, the majority of children paid very little \\nattention or none at all. \\nHolt\\'s observations suggest that differences in attention have important \\neffects on the degree to which people learn. He also suggests that most of \\nus have imperfect control of our attention. \\nWatching older kids study, or try to study, I saw after a while that they \\nwere not sufficiently self-aware to know when their minds had wandered '),\n",

Most of us have very imperfect control over our atten\\xad\\ntion . Our minds slip away from duty before we realize that they are gone. \\nLack of attention to a task is not simply a result of laziness or lack of \\ninterest. Attention can also be affected by fear and anxiety. For example, \\nit can be very difficult to focus attentively on a problem while we are \\nconcerned with competing thoughts about personal problems or about \\nfears that we may fail. \\nDifficulties caused by competing thoughts can be illustrated by con\\xad\\nsidering a problem we presented to a number of college students. We \\nasked them to note their thoughts and feelings from the moment they \\nread the following problem. You might try this, too . \\nTwo train stations are 50 miles apart. At I P .M . on Sunday a train pulls \\nout from each of the stations , and the trains start toward one another. \\nJust as the trains pull out from the stations a hawk flies into the air in \\nfront of the first train and flies ahead to the front of the second train. \\nWhen the hawk reaches the second train, it turns around and flies \\ntoward the first train. The hawk continues in this way until the trains \\nmeet . Assume that both trains travel at a speed of 25 miles per hour \\nand that the hawk flies at a constant speed of I 00 miles per hour. How \\nmany miles will the hawk have flown when the trains meet? \\nFor many of the students, initial reactions to the problem included \\nsuch thoughts as \"Oh no, this is a mathematical word problem-! hate \\nthose things\"; \"Boy, am I going to look stupid\"; and \"I hope I don\\'t have \\nto turn in my answer.\" Furthermore, these negative thoughts occurred \\noften throughout the five minutes allotted to the task. Such thoughts \\nmake it difficult to concentrate on problems, and indeed, despite the fact \\nthat the preceding problem requires no sophisticated math skills, a large \\nnumber of the students got it wrong. (Try to solve it if you haven\\'t done \\nso already. The answer is presented in Appendix A.) \\nFears of failure and of looking stupid are not the only feelings that \\ncan interfere with attention . All of us sometimes need to perform tasks \\n(study for a test or prepare for a presentation at the office) that we really \\ndon\\'t want to perform.

People need to know what to do as well as what not to \\ndo. Thanks to research that has been conducted during the past 20 years \\nor so, we now know a great deal about the processes used in successful \\nproblem solving . 16 This information is often available only in piecemeal \\nfashion and only in relatively technical scientific books and journals; \\nfurthermore, it is usually presented in a way that can be quite difficult to \\nunderstand . Our goal is to make the existing information about problem \\nsolving both comprehensible and useful. We also furnish extensive refer\\xad\\nences to the scientific research that provides the basis for our discussion. \\nThe book is divided into two parts. In Part 1 we present a model for \\nanalyzing the processes that underlie effective problem solving, and we \\ndiscuss various ways that this model can be used to he lp peop le access \\nand apply knowledge and skills that they have already learned . For ex\\xad\\nample, one purpose of the model is to increase people's awareness of \\nvarious aspects of the problem-solving process so that they can analyze \\ntheir own approaches to pro b lems. We especially emphasize the impor\\xad\\ntance of viewing problems from a variety of perspectives so that creative \\nso lutions are more likely to be discovered. The model presented in Chap\\xad\\nter 2 is used throughout the rest of the book. \\nChapters 3 and 4 emphasize ways to enhance creativity and the \\nimportance of being able to criticize ideas. Chapter 3 discusses how the \\nIDEAL mode l can be used to enhance your creativity. People's abilities to \\nformulate creative so lutions to prob l ems are often hampered by implicit \\nassumptions; hence, it is important to analyze these ass u mptions and \\nconsider alternatives. We discuss strategies for making implicit ass u mp\\xad\\ntions explicit and for generating a wide range of novel ideas. \\nIn Chapter 4 we discuss strategies for spotting flaws in arguments \\nthat others, or we ourselves, might make. These strateg ies are important \\nbecause-whether the domain is advertising, persona l conversation, or \\nscience-we are all bombarded by a host of supposedly factua l and logical \\narguments that, when ana lyzed carefu ll y, are fo u nd to b e fu ll of ho les. \\nChapter 5 focuses on effective communication. A variety of strat\\xad\\negies can he lp us communicate our ideas more effectively. We emphasize \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content=\"The Importance of Problem Solving IIIII \\nthat different strategies are necessary, depending on with whom we are \\ncommunicating, how we are communicating (orally or in writing, for \\nexample), and what we are trying to accomplish. \\nThroughout the discussion in Part 1 it becomes obvious that the \\nimprovement of problem-solving skills requires that people be able to \\nlearn effectively. Just as we must learn to use physical tools (hammers or \\ncomputers) to solve certain kinds of problems, we must also learn to use \\nconceptual tools (strategies for remembering, concepts and theories that \\nfacilitate the comprehension of patterns, and so on). In Part 2 we discuss \\nways to learn new information. Chapter 6 discusses ways to improve \\nmemory. We emphasize that different types of strategies are necessary for \\ndifferent goals or purposes. For example, some strategies are sufficient for \\nshort-term memory but not for long-term memory. Even for long-term \\nmemory, strategies must be varied depending on the nature of the prob\\xad\\nlem. Thus, the problem of devising strategies for remembering people's \\nnames when you see them is different from the problem of studying for \\nan essay test. \\nChapter 7 discusses the strategies needed to comprehend new infor\\xad\\nmation. We emphasize that such strategies are different from those re\\xad\\nquired to simply memorize information. We also show why the strategies \\nnecessary for adequate comprehension are generally more difficult than \\nthose needed for merely memorization. Nevertheless, the extra effort is \\nworthwhile because information that is comprehended can serve as a \\nconceptual tool for solving subsequent problems we may confront. \\nIn Chapter 8 we discuss some reasons that formal educational en\\xad\\nvironments do not always promote the acquisition of knowledge and \\nskills that can be transferred easily to problem solving. We then consider \\nsome new approaches to instruction that are designed to help people \\nlearn in ways that allow them to apply new information more readily to \\nproblem-solving tasks. \\nI Notes \\n1.

In short, you won't always want to go through the IDEAL \\ncomponents in a fixed order. This will become clearer as you gain exper\\xad\\nience using IDEAL. \\nI= ldentifij Problems and Opportunities \\nThe first component of the IDEAL approach is to identify potential \\nproblems and treat them as opportunities to do something creative. \\nWhen problems are treated as opportunities, the result is often a solution \\nor invention that otherwise would have eluded you. In fact, it can be \\nbeneficial to actively attempt to identify problems that have gone un\\xad\\nnoticed. Most books on problem solving begin with the assumption that \\nyou have already experienced problems rather than stress the impor\\xad\\ntance of actively attempting to locate them. As we shall see, however, \\npeople who identify important problems and treat them as opportunities \\nare often among the most successful in their fields . \\nThe importance of actively identifying problems that provide oppor\\xad\\ntunities for improvement is nicely illustrated by Edwin Bliss. Bliss discus\\xad\\nses the experiences of Marks ·and Spencer, a prosperous retail chain in \\nBritain. 4 Members of that organization discovered a problem that had \\ngone undetected for many years: too much unnecessary paperwork. The \\ncompany had a procedure for filling out cards on merchandise sold to \\nkeep track of inventory; nearly a million such cards were filled out each \\nyear. Similarly , each employee was required to fill out a daily time card \\nindicating the number of hours worked; again, this amounted to approxi-\"),\n",

After some thought, company repre\\xad\\nsentatives realized that all this paperwork was unnecessary and that \\nmore efficient procedures existed for inventory control. By treating the \\ndiscovery of this problem as an opportunity for creative action, the busi\\xad\\nness was made much more efficient. Within a year after the paperwork \\nproblem was discovered , 26 million cards and sheets of paper ( 120 tons' \\nworth) had been eliminated. \\nLadislao Biro and his brother Georg provide another illustration of \\nseeing problems as opportunities. 5 They were proofreaders and spent a \\ngreat deal of time checking for errors . To communicate these errors to \\nothers, they needed to write things down, and it was important to write \\nin ink because pencil often fades. However, the only way to write in ink \\nwas to use a fountain pen , which was messy and time-consuming. Al\\xad\\nthough you are probably not familiar with the names of these men, you \\nare undoubtedly familiar with their invention, the ballpoint pen. The \\ncompany they created is now part of a corporation known as BIC. \\nA common reason for people's failure to identify problems and view \\nthem as opportunities is that they do not stop to think about the pos\\xad\\nsibility of improving a situation. Instead, they tend to take inconvenien\\xad\\nces and unpleasant situations for granted and accept them as facts of life. \\nOur earlier discussion of traffic congestion caused by the lack of traffic \\nrules illustrates this . People in the 1850s presumably did not like traffic \\ncongestion, but most did not take the time to ask whether it might not \\nrepresent an opportunity for creative thinking. Until this was done, no \\none attempted to consider systematically how the problem might be \\nsolved. \\nA friend of ours recently discovered an example from his everyday \\nlife of taking something for granted rather than adopting a problem-solv\\xad\\ning approach: the task of frying bacon. For years he had never questioned \\nthe fact that he often got splattered with grease. He simply accepted this \\nas a fact of life. \\nOne day, while looking through a mail-order catalog, our friend \\ndiscovered the object illustrated in Figure 4. This device does an excellent \\njob of protecting cooks from hot, splattering bacon grease. What im\\xad\\npressed our friend most was not the invention itself, which represented a \\nrelatively straightforward solution to the grease problem. Instead, he was \\nimpressed that someone had identified the problem in the first place and \\nviewed it as an opportunity. Our friend had never thought explicitly \\nabout the fact that splattering grease signified the existence of a problem \\nthat, once identified, might be solved. \"),\n",

The objects \\nillustrated in Figure 5 represent just a few of our favorite inventions. 6 \\nNote that the first step taken by the inventors of these objects was to identify the \\nproblems that the objects were designed to solve. Ideally, an inventor wants to \\nidentify problems shared by a large number of people. This increases the \\nprobability that the inventions will sell. (Ask yourself whether you have \\nfaced the problems that the inventions in Figure 5 are designed to solve.) \\nI Failure to ldentif~ the Possibilit~ of Future Problems \\nThe preceding discussion emphasized situations in which people tended \\nto accept unpleasant situations and as a result failed to ask whether they \\npointed to the existence of a problem that might be solved. Other ex\\xad\\namples of the importance of identifying problems are situations in which \\none fails to realize that actions or policies may lead to problems later on. \\nFor example, during the 1980s the United States relaxed the regulation \\nof the banking industry, making it easier for banks to make speculative \\nloans. Few people realized the magnitude of the problem that would \\nensue as real estate values declined. The U.S. taxpayers have already paid \\nabout $100 billion to rescue failed banks, and some estimate the total cost \\nwill be closer to $500 billion. On a more everyday level, people who \\ncarefully balance their checkbooks after each transaction are less likely to \\nexperience the trauma (and expense) of an overdrawn account. \\nConsider the following example of the importance of predicting \\nproblems that may arise in the future.

As it turned out, the new number provided by the phone \\ncompany had previously been the number of an all-night pizza place. \\nWhen the calls first started coming in, we would say, \"No, you have \\nthe wrong number\" and try to go back to sleep as quickly as possible . \\nWithout fail, the phone would ring again 30 seconds later and the same \\ncaller would be on the line . Since the number of the pizza place was in \\nthe current phone book, the callers assumed they had misdialed the first \\ntime around. \\nOnce we identified the problem with the way we answered the \\nphone, we changed our strategy, saying, \"The number has been \\nchanged.\" The moral of the story is that it pays to look for potential \\nproblems. If problems are not identified, solutions to them are unlikely to \\nbe proposed . \\nD =Define Goals \\nThe second aspect of the IDEAL approach to problem solving is to care\\xad\\nfully define your goals in the problem situation. This is different from \\nidentifying the problem. For example, a group of people could identify \\nthe existence of a general problem and agree that it represents an oppor\\xad\\ntunity but still disagree about what their goals should be. Different goals \\noften reflect differences in how people understand a problem . \\nConsider the problem of disposing of waste generated by individuals \\nand businesses. Although there is general agreement that we are running \\nout of space in our landfills, there are many different ways to define our \\ngoals in this situation. One possible goal would be to find alternative ways \\nof disposing of trash other than landfills. Another would be to reduce the \\namount of trash generated in the first place . Different goals can lead \\npeople to explore very different strategies for solving a problem. If our goal \\nis to find alternative ways of disposing of trash, we might consider such \\nideas as incineration or sending the trash to some remote location. On the \\nother hand, if our goal is to reduce the trash being generated, we might \\nconsider recycling or encouraging companies to package goods in reusable \\ncontainers. Of course, you often may want to pursue multiple goals. \\nThe difference between identifying problems that represent oppor\\xad\\ntunities and defining one\\'s goals can be clarified further by considering \\nthe example of the frying bacon. A number of people might identify the \\nsplattering grease as a problem representing an opportunity. Neverthe\\xad\\nless, the way they define their goals could differ. One possible goal would '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content=\"H Model tor Improving Problem-Solving Skills IIlii \\nbe to reduce the heat that causes grease to splatter. Here the emphasis is \\non the importance of heat, and the solution to the problem would focus \\non ways to reduce this factor. One solution is to turn down the heat on \\nthe stove (assuming that one is cooking over a stove). If the heat source \\nis not variable (if one is cooking over a campfire, for example), the \\nsolution could be to increase the distance between the frying pan and the \\nfire. \\nAnother way to define your goal could be to make people less \\nsusceptible to burns from bacon grease. This emphasizes people's vul\\xad\\nnerability to burns, and the solutions would focus on ways to make them \\nless vulnerable. A long-sleeved, heat-resistant glove would be a good \\nsolution given this definition of the problem. \\nA third goal would be to reduce the distance the hot grease travels. \\nThis goal leads one to consider that hot grease splatters and can travel \\nrelatively long distances; the solution would therefore focus on ways to \\ndecrease the grease's journey. The invention illustrated in Figure 4 is one \\nsolution that might be expected to stem from such a problem definition. \\nJames Adams provides an excellent example of how our problem\\xad\\nsolving goals can affect the strategies we considerJ He describes the \\nexperiences of a group of engineers who were attempting to design a \\nmechanical tomato picker that could harvest tomatoes in large quantities \\nwithout bruising them. \\nThe engineers initially defined their goal as optimizing the design of \\nmechanical pickers so that tomatoes do not get bruised and damaged. As you can \\nimagine, this led them to consider various strategies for modifying the \\nmachine, such as slowing it down to reduce the impact or padding its \\narms. Although all of these solution strategies were plausible, none was \\nconsidered a breakthrough . \\nIt wasn't until people considered alternative ways of defining the \\ngoal-such as creating a tomato that is less likely to be bruised-that they \\nwere able to explore a more productive solution like breeding tomatoes \\nthat would be less likely to be damaged by mechanical pickers. By explor\\xad\\ning strategies to modify the tomato, the problem was eventually solved. \\nGrowers and packers can now supply grocery stories with large quantities \\nof inexpensive , unbruised tomatoes. \\nWe have found that people often fail to consider alternative goals \\nwhen they attempt to solve a problem. Instead, they jump immediately \\nto the exploration of strategies . For example, when one of us was work\\xad\\ning with a team of engineers who were exploring strategies to protect \\npeople in automobile crashes, most of those involved immediately started \"),\n",

When people \\nrealized there were alternative goals for solving this problem, such as \\npreventing crashes or reducing the damage caused to humans hitting the \\ndashboard, they began to search for information that was relevant to \\nstrategies such as braking systems that are automatically activated when \\na crash is imminent or soft, shock-absorbing steering wheels and dash\\xad\\nboard components. \\nI The Importance of Conceptual Inventions \\nPeople do not simply invent objects (such as a splatter screen to protect \\nagainst hot grease) that help them solve various problems.

The creation of units of \\nmeasurement, such as miles per gallon, passenger-miles per gallon, and miles \\nper tankful, are cases in point. \\nImagine that you are a consultant for a company that wants to \\npurchase a fleet of vehicles to be used to transport executives to and from \\nwork . Your task is to find the most fuel - efficient way to reach the \\ncompany's goal. One goal could be to find the type of vehicle that gets the \\nmost miles per gallon . This particular goal may focus your attention on the \\nmost fuel-efficient vehicle that can be used to transport an executive to \\nand from work. \\nAnother way to define your goal might be to find a vehicle that can \\ntransport the largest number of executives who live close to one another \\nto and from work. In this case, you might evaluate different types of \\nvehicles in terms of passenger -miles per gallon rather than merely miles per \\ngallon. Emphasizing passenger-miles might suggest that it would be more \\neconomical to purchase vans or even a bus. \\nSeveral years ago, when gasoline was scarce because of a severe oil \\nshortage, many car makers focused on the concept of miles per tankful. For \\npeople who had to travel long distances with no assurance of finding a \\ngas station, the unit of miles per tankful was more relevant than miles per \\ngallon . The goal in that situation was not to find a vehicle that would \\npermit people to go the most miles on the fewest gallons, but to find a \"),\n",

This often involves \\na reanalysis of your goals plus a consideration of options or strategies that \\nmight be employed to achieve those goals. \\nIn Chapter l we discussed some approaches to problems that people \\noften do not realize they are taking. These approaches include physical \\nescapes from problem situations (the let-me-out-of-here approach), as \\nwell as mental escapes in which one avoids problems by thinking of \\nsomething else. However, even when people explicitly try to solve prob\\xad\\nlems they often fail to use appropriate strategies. This is in part because \\nmany people seem to be unaware of the importance of taking strategic \\napproaches to problems . In other cases people may be aware of the \\ngeneral importance of strategies yet not have learned the specific strategies \\nneeded for the problem they are trying to solve. \\nOne way to think about strategies is in terms of their generality. \\nSome strategies for problem solving are very general and apply to almost \\nany problem you might consider. Others are very specific and apply only \\nin a small set of circumstances. We begin by discussing some relatively \\ngeneral strategies and then consider the issue of specific strategies that are \\nappropriate to particular types of problems. \\nI The Importance of S~stematic Rnal~sis \\nConsider first the general process of analyzing problems systematically . \\nWhen we watch others solve problems we cannot observe what goes on \\nin their heads. It is therefore easy to assume that their answers just came \\nto them and that, if answers don\\'t just come to us, there is nothing we \\ncan do. \\nOf course, there are times when answers do seem simply to pop into \\none\\'s mind. If you are asked, \"What\\'s two times two?\" for example, you \\nautomatically say, \"Four\"; the answer is overlearned. However, consider \\nthe following problem. '),\n",

Instead, these experienced problem solvers took a very \\ncareful, systematic approach. In particular, they usually broke complex \\nproblems into simpler ones that could each be solved more easily . Given \\nthe problem just presented, for example, effective problem solvers might \\nask themselves: \\n1. What is today if two days from now will be Sunday? \\n(Friday) \\n2. If today is Friday, what is the day before yesterday? \\n(Wednesday) \\n3 . What day follows Wednesday? (Thursday) \\nThe problem becomes quite simple when broken into its component \\nparts. Furthermore, human beings seem to need to break complex prob\\xad\\nlems into component parts in order to succeed. \\nProceeding systematically is also necessary for effective reading \\ncomprehension . Arthur and Linda Whimbey provide information rele\\xad\\nvant to this point. 9 They presented the following passage to college stu\\xad\\ndents w h o had comprehension difficulties. \\nIf a serious literary critic were to write a favorable, full-length review of \\nHow Could I Tell Mother She Frightened My Boyfriends Away , Grace \\nPlumbuster \\'s new story , his startled readers would assume that he had \\ngone mad , or that Grace Plumbuster was his editor \\'s wife. \\nThe Whimbeys note that the college students who were poor compre\\xad\\nhenders \\nfailed to take a systematic approach to the problem. They state: \\nThis was the first sentence of a reading comprehension article , and I had \\nto stop for a moment and reread a portion of it in order to understand its \\nmeaning completely . Not so for the low-aptitude student I was testing . \\nHe was halfway down the page by the time I had the details of the first \\nsentence sorted out. I asked him if he understood the sentence , and he \\nanswered \" No, not really .\" So I suggest e d he give it another try. '),\n",

One-shot thinking (Bereiter and \\nEnglemann 's term) is the basis on which the poor reader makes inter\\xad\\npretations and draws conclusions. \\nI The Importance of Using External Representations \\nFor many problems it is easy to consider all the relevant information \\nwithout experiencing a strain on short-term memory capacity . As the \\nproblems we work on increase in complexity, however, it becomes more \\nand more difficult to keep track of all this information. Indeed, in some \\nsituations the problem solver's goal may be to find a good way of keeping \\ntrack of it. Assume, for example, that you are confronted with the task of \\noperating a large corporation or even managing a small business inven\\xad\\ntory. People responsible for such tasks often rely on computers, charts, \\nand graphs to help them represent all the information needed to make \\npurchasing and management decisions. Without these aids, they could \\nnot cope with the deluge of information. \\nOf course, one does not have to operate a business to run into this \\ndifficulty. Experienced problem solvers often keep track of information \\nby creating external representations. Rather than trying to keep all the \\ninformation in their heads, they move it into the outside world-they put \\nit on paper, for example, so they can think more freely about the problem \\nthey are trying to solve. \\nAs an illustration, try the following problem. 10 \\nThere are three separate, equal-sized boxes. Inside each box are two \\nseparate, small boxes, and inside each of the small boxes are four even \\nsmaller boxes. How many boxes are there altogether? \\nMany people quickly realize the need to represent the problem by draw\\xad\\ning, but many others do not. We know college students who attempted \\nto do this problem in their heads and had difficulty with it. This was \\nespecially true of younger students with whom we have worked (fourth \\nand fifth graders). Performance improved considerably when the stu \\xad\\ndents were prompted to draw a representation of the problem (although \\nthere is still one aspect of the problem that is easy to overlook, even after \\nit is drawn out; the answer to this problem appears in Appendix A). \"),\n",

R Framework tor Using Hnowledge More Effectivelij \\nHere is another problem that requires an externalization of memory \\n(though that\\'s not all it requires) . \\nA man had four chains, each three links long. He wanted to join the four \\nchains into a single, closed chain . Having a link opened cost 2 cents and \\nhaving a link closed cost 3 cents. The man had his chains joined into a \\nclosed chain for I 5 cents. How did he do it? \\nBy actually drawing the four chains, you don\\'t have to use your memory to \\nkeep imagining them (the answer to the problem appears in Appendix A). \\nThere are many other ways of externalizing memory to keep track \\nof information. Additional examples, such as the use of graphs and Venn \\ndiagrams, are discussed later. For the moment, the important point is that \\nproblems can often be represented in a variety of ways, yet some repre\\xad\\nsentations are more likely to lead to efficient solutions than others. For \\nexample, if you are asked, \"What is two-thirds of one-half?\" you might \\nrepresent it on paper as ~3 x l/2. A simpler way to think of the problem is \\n\"What is one-half of two-thirds?\" \\nIt is important to recognize that the most effective way to represent \\ninformation will depend on the nature of the problem and how we define \\nour goals. John Hayes 11 and Diane Halpern 12 note that some problems \\nare better solved if one uses a verbal representation, whereas others are \\nbetter represented visually or perhaps mathematically. In some situations \\nthe most effective methods for representing information may differ from \\nthose that we typically use. For example, Ruth Day 13 has found that \\npeople often fail to use representations that would make it easier to \\nachieve their goals. Effective problem solvers explore a variety of repre\\xad\\nsentations. We will explore alternative ways of representing information \\nlater when we consider strategies that can facilitate learning. \\nI Some Additional General Strategies \\nIn addition to working systematically, breaking a problem into parts, and \\nusing external representations, good problem solvers rely on other \\ngeneral strategies to help them achieve their goals. Working a problem \\nbackward is one such strategy. In many situations a problem can be \\nworked backward more easily than it can be worked forward. For ex\\xad\\nample, imagine that you have to meet someone for lunch at a restaurant \\nacross town and you do not want to be late. It is much easier to solve the \\nproblem of determining when to leave by working backward: If you '),\n",

M. departure) . \\nGenerally speaking, working backward is a good strategy to use when\\xad\\never the goal state of a problem is clear and the beginning state is unclear. \\nConsider the following problem (see Appendix A for the answer) . \\nIt is 4 P.M. and you have just learned that you are expected for an impor\\xad\\ntant company meeting in Chicago at 8 the next morning. There are two \\nflights open. One is a dinner flight that leaves at 6 P.M. and arrives in \\nChicago at 6 A.M . the next day . The other flight departs at 7:30 P.M. and \\narrives in Chicago at 7 :30 A.M. the next day. When you arrive in Chicago \\nyou will need to wait 20 minutes for your luggage and it will take 20 \\nminutes by taxi to get to your meeting . Which flight should you take, and \\nwill you need to buy dinner? \\nAnother general strategy that good problem solvers often use is to \\nwork out a complex or abstract problem by focusing on a simpler, specific \\nsituation. 14 Building scale models or performing experiments that simu\\xad\\nlate certain characteristics of a real-world environment are good ex\\xad\\namples of this strategy. Consider the following problem (see Appendix A \\nfor the answer). \\nYou are the director for an upcoming racquetball tournament, and I 03 \\npeople have entered the open single-elimination tournament (after losing \\nonce, the player is eliminated). If you need a score card for each match, \\nhow many cards will you need if each player shows up? (Hint Work out \\nthe problem for a very simple case first.) \\nI The Importance of Specialized Concepts and Strategies \\nSo far, our discussion of the e xplore phase of IDEAL has emphasized such \\nstrategies as breaking a problem into parts , working backward , and using \\na specific case . These are general strategies that are important for problem \\nsolving. However, studies of effective problem solvers reveal that they \\nhave much more than a repertoire of general strategies; they also have a \\ngreat deal of specialized knowledge that allows them to understand \\nwhen, how, and why to apply a host of specific strategies. It is very \\ndifficult to solve problems without knowledge of these specifics. 15 '),\n",

Assuming the gold\\xad\\nen idol was solid gold and that it and the bag of sand were approximately \\nthe same size, is it reasonable to assume that the idol and the bag of sand \\nweighed approximately the same? \\nTo solve this problem, you clearly need to do more than break the prob\\xad\\nlem into parts . You also need some way to estimate the weight of a bag of \\nsand and a golden idol of approximately the same volume. Since the \\nobjects are not available, you cannot weigh them directly. How else might \\nyou proceed? \\nPeople who have learned and understood the concept of density are \\nable to generate a strategy for solving this problem . They know that \\ndifferent types of materials have different densities and that density \\ntables can be found in some science texts . By consulting these tables, it is \\neasy to determine that the density of a solid-gold object is approximately \\n19.4 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas the density of sand is ap\\xad\\nproximately 2 grams per cubic centimeter. This means that a golden idol \\nof the size depicted in the movie would weigh approximately 60 pounds. \\nIn contrast, the bag of sand would weigh only about 6 pounds. \\nNote that the strategy of consulting a density table to solve the \\nIndiana Jones problem requires knowing about the concept of density. \\nWithout it, it is very difficult to know how to proceed . There is often no \\nsubstitute for specialized knowledge when solving certain types of prob\\xad\\nlems. For example, by learning concepts in algebra and geometry (con\\xad\\ncepts that have been refined over the centuries), it becomes possible to \\nsolve a variety of problems that otherwise would be extremely difficult if \\nnot impossible to solve. Similarly, concepts in physics enable people to \\nsolve such problems as how to put a satellite into orbit at a particular \\ndistance from the earth, and concepts in biology help us to alleviate \\nvarious infectious diseases. All areas of study, including biology, psychol\\xad\\nogy, economics, physics, and chemistry, among many others, involve \\ncore concepts and theories that people have found helpful in defining \\nand solving important problems.

For example, it could have asked people how they would feel if the \\ndrink they had been purchasing all their lives were no longer available. \\nAn article in the Wall Street Journa/ 18 discusses the importance of \\nanticipating the consequences of one\\'s strategies. Entitled \"Building a \\nBetter Mousetrap Doesn\\'t Ensure Success,\" the article discusses the plight \\nof several companies that have attempted to deal with a problem faced by \\nthousands of stores across the country: the theft of shopping carts. Since \\nthe carts cost around $90 each, a store can lose a considerable amount of \\nmoney in a year. \\nDifferent companies have come up with different solutions for the \\nshopping cart problem. Several of them involve locking up carts when \\nthey are not in use. For example, customers may have to pay to unlock a \\ncart and get their money back when they return the cart to its original \\nlocation. \\nImagine that you are a grocery store owner trying to decide whether \\nto invest in an antitheft shopping cart system. There are a number of \\nsteps you might take to anticipate the effects of implementing such as \\nsystem. First you might estimate the number of carts that you lose per \\nyear, calculate the cost, and decide that the locked-cart system would pay \\nfor itself within a year. Then you might test the invention that locks up \\nthe carts and find that it works very reliably. Finally, you might recall \\nhaving seen similar types of devices in airports and conclude that since \\nthe invention worked there it should work for your store as well. \\nIdeally, there are additional steps that you would take before pur\\xad\\nchasing a locked-cart system. One concern should be customer percep\\xad\\ntion-you need to anticipate their reactions to locked carts. A negative \\nreaction could be caused by inconvenience. If the cart system requires \\ncustomers to have correct change, what will they do when they don\\'t \\nhave it? If the store is busy, many customers will not want to spend time \\nstanding in line at a change machine. \\nAnother, potentially more serious, reaction to a locked-cart system \\nis that many customers will react negatively if a store suddenly appears \\nnot to trust them. The consequences could be severe. Note that people \\nare probably much less likely to feel the same way about locked-cart \\nsystems in airports. Airports are visited by masses of people, and many \\nother types of security measures have already been put in place to protect \\nthe public. Also, airports usually have a monopoly on air travel so that \\ncustomers cannot always seek other alternatives. Therefore, the fact that \\na system works in an airport may not mean that it will work well some\\xad\\nplace else. '),\n",

Will that strategy be sufficient to achieve your goal of doing \\nwell on the test? \\nMost students know that they have to anticipate the consequences \\nof using a particular study strategy in light of the test requirements . If the \\ntest will involve a presentation of one or two paragraphs from the text \\nwith the r e quirement that students explain the meaning of the para\\xad\\ngraphs in their own words, the study strategy noted above (to read each \\nchapter twice) may be adequate. On the other hand, if the test requires \\nstudents to recall key concepts from the text and discuss them in order of \\nimportance, that same study strategy will probably be insufficient. (See \\nChapter 7 for more discussion of this issue . ) Unless students anticipate \\nthe effects of adopting particular study strategies by acting on them, they \\ncannot make adjustments that will ensure success. In our example, the \\nbest way to anticipate probable effects is to actua ll y perform various tasks \\nsuch as recalling key concepts from the book chapters. If you are not \\nsuccessful, you will know ahead of time that you need to change your \\napproach . \\nThe previous discussion shows that it is often necessary to act on \\nour strategies before we can anticipate possible outcomes .

Strategies for debugging-looking at and learning from \\nyour approach to studying-are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7. \\nThe cannonball problem presented below provides another illus\\xad\\ntration of the importance of the look and learn phase of problem solving. \\nDo not try to solve the entire cannonball problem right away. Instead, \\nfocus on the first step toward a solution that comes to mind. Here is the \\nproblem. \\nThere are 12 cannonballs. They all look alike, but one is the oddball. The \\noddball is either heavier or lighter than the other balls. You are supplied \\nwith a balance scale that can hold as many cannonballs as you like on \\neach side. The problem is, in four weighings (four uses of the scale), find \\nthe oddball. \\nTry only the first step in this problem-that is , the first weighing-and then \\nconsider what you have found out . We have given this problem to more than \\n300 college students. The first strategy considered by over 90 percent of \\nthem is to place six cannonballs on each side of the scale to determine the \\nside that contains the oddball. Once students actively attempt this strat\\xad\\negy and look at the possible effects, they discover a dilemma: They still do \\nnot know which side the oddball is on. \\nAfter the initial weighing, most students understand the problem in \\na different way . They now understand that the difficulty of the problem \\nlies in the fact that the oddball can be either lighter or heavier ; hence, the \\nsix-six weighing does not tell them which side the oddball is on. Note that \\nwithout actively trying out their initial strategy and looking at the effects, \\nthe definition of oddball would not be adequately understood. (You may \\nnow want to continue to try to solve the oddball problem. The answer is \\nin Appendix A . ) \\nIn addition to looking at the effects of one's actions or decisions, it is \\nimportant to learn from the experience . Ideally, one learns something \\ngeneral so that subsequent attempts at problem solving can be improved. \\nFor example, imagine that you have created a new advertisement for a \\nproduct and had attempted to anticipate its effects by using a focus group \\nof businessmen and women .

Each of these components has impor\\xad\\ntant effects on how well a problem can be solved. \\nIn our discussion, different types of problems were used to illustrate \\ndifferent components. For example, the splattering bacon grease problem \\nwas used to illustrate the importance of identifying opportunities as well \\nas defining goals; the Classic Coke example was used to illustrate the \\nanticipate and look components. It is important to note that solving any \\nproblem actually involves all five components of the IDEAL framework. \\nIn addition, the solution usually involves a number of passes through the \\nIDEAL cycle. \\nConsider the problem of comprehending a passage. Assume that an \\neffective reader encounters the statement, \"The haystack was important \\nbecause the cloth ripped.\" Unlike a less effective reader, who may simply \\nbe going through the motions of reading while actually daydreaming, the \\neffective reader will realize that a problem exists (that is, he or she will \\nidentify the existence of a problem). Furthermore, the effective reader will \\nview the identification of the problems as being good rather than bad. It \\nrepresents an opportunity to clarify what is not understood. \\nAfter the problem has been identzfied, the reader must carefully \\ndefine his or her goals. For example, the reader may assume that the \\nsentence is incomprehensible because of a lack of information. Perhaps \\nhis or her attention had lapsed, causing crucial information in the text to \\nbe missed. The goal might then be to find the information that would \\nrender the statement comprehensible. This goal will lead to exploring such \\nstrategies as going back and rereading the preceding text for information \\nthat would help to illuminate the confusing statement . The student \\nreader therefore anticipate the effects of using this strategy and act on it by \\nactually rereading. He or she can then look and learn from these activities \\nby evaluating whether they helped to solve the problem of what the \\nsentence means. \\nAssume that the act of rereading does not solve the reader\\'s com\\xad\\nprehension problem. To the extent that he or she realizes this, a problem \\nhas again been identified. The reader must then define new goals, explore \\npossible strategies, and so forth. In short, the reader has reentered the '),\n",

The creative person will often redefine his \\nor her goals and try to use strategies that differ considerably from those \\nused previously. For example, the creative problem solver may reex\\xad\\nperience the failure to comprehend the haystack sentence and redefine \\nthe goal as attempting to use his or her own knowledge to make sense of the \\nsentence . This redefinition of goals suggests a new strategy. Rather than \\nrereading, the optimal strategy is to generate a context that allows the \\nsentence to make sense (if you find yourself trying to discover such a \\ncontext, the word \"parachute\" should help). Strategies for enhancing \\ncreativity are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3. \\nI Blocks to Creative Problem Solving \\nAs you gain experience working with the IDEAL framework, you will \\nnotice that it often involves dealing with failure or frustration. If you \\nidentify a problem with your own ideas or statements, for example, it can \\nbe difficult to admit it. Similarly, as you define new goals (and hence reject \\nearlier ones) or act on strategies and find a need to explore alternative \\nplans, you may find yourself reacting negatively. This is natural; all of us \\nwould rather be right about everything than wrong on occasion. Never\\xad\\ntheless, the IDEAL problem solver views these kinds of experiences as \\nopportunities rather than failures. The major opportunity they provide is \\nto learn something new. And the earlier in the IDEAL cycle you can find \\nthe need to change direction, the better it is for you. \\nScientists often must attempt to think about problems from new \\nperspectives. According to the popular portrayal, scientists are supposed \\nto be totally objective and seek only the truth. In actuality, scientists are \\nmuch more human than this suggests. Their humanity has both positive \\nand negative implications. On the positive side, scientists generally make \\nbetter parents, friends, and spouses than one would expect from a cold\\xad\\nhearted individual. On the negative side, scientists may have difficulty \\nabandoning sets of assumptions that are near and dear to their hearts. \\nThe physicist David Bohm discusses the emotional impact of receiv\\xad\\ning criticism that questions one\\'s initial approach to the definition of a \\nproblem. He describes a scientist\\'s reaction to alternative assumptions \\nproposed by another scientist. 18 '),\n",

Nevertheless, if he will \\n\"stay with it\" rather than escape into anger and unjustified rejection of \\ncontrary ideas, he will discover that this disturbance is very beneficial. \\nFor now he becomes aware of the assumptive character of a great many \\npreviously unquestioned features of his own thinking. This does not mean \\nthat he will reject these assumptions in favor of those of other people . \\nRather, what is needed is the conscious criticism of one\\'s own meta\\xad\\nphysics, leading to changes where appropriate and ultimately, to the \\ncontinual creation of new and different kinds. \\nOf course, scientists are not the only people who have difficulty \\nredefining their goals because of emotional attachment to a set of as\\xad\\nsumptions. Nearly all people experience such difficulties at one point or \\nanother . When this happens, we fail to critically evaluate our assump\\xad\\ntions. The IDEAL approach provides an important reminder of the value \\nof questioning assumptions and defining our goals in new ways . \\nI Summar~ \\nOur goal in this chapter was to provide a model that can be used to \\nimprove problem solving. The modeL represented by the acronym \\nIDEAL, emphasizes five components of the problem - solving process: \\nidentify , define , explore, anticipate/act , and look/learn . Each of these com\\xad\\nponents is involved in any attempt to solve a problem; furthermore, \\npeople often need to move through the IDEAL cycle flexibly and repeat \\nthe cycle several times to arrive at a satisfactory solution. Creative prob\\xad\\nlem solvers are especially likely to view a problem from a variety of \\nperspectives; that is, to define their goals in a number of different ways. \\nIn the remaining chapters we will apply the IDEAL model to situa\\xad\\ntions in which people must solve such problems as spotting flaws in \\narguments and communicating effectively . In Part 2 we will e x amine \\nproblems such as remembering sets of facts, comprehending new infor\\xad\\nmation , and learning in ways that facilitate future problem-solving tasks. \\nSince the IDEAL model provides the organizing structure for the rest of \\nthis book, it is important that you understand it and are able to use it in \\na variety of ways. To help you reach this goaL we include at the end of \\nthis and other chapters a number of exercises designed to provide prac \\xad\\ntice in thinking within the IDEAL framework. The exercises are meant to '),\n",

Some involve problem solving while others \\ninvolve quotations , statements of fact, and so forth. The exercises il\\xad\\nlustrate how the IDEAL framework can be used to think about a variety \\nof situations. The best way to work with these exercises is first to read the \\nproblem or statement, then to think about it for a while, and finally to \\nturn to the answers at the back of the book (Appendix B) to see how we \\nthought about the problem from the IDEAL perspective. Our thoughts \\nwill not be the only correct ones, and they may be less interesting than \\nyour own. Nevertheless, by seeing how we use the IDEAL approach to \\nthink about experiences, you should learn to see the world from this \\nperspective and evaluate whether or not it may be useful for you. \\nI Exercises \\nTry to solve the two following problems as quickly as possible. \\n1.

It is therefore important \\nto ask, \"Where is creativity in the IDEAL framework?\" It may seem \\nsurprising, but processes for enhancing creativity are everywhere in the \\nIDEAL model; they are involved in identifying problems and opportun\\xad\\nities, defining goals, exploring possible strategies, and so forth. Our goal in \\nthis chapter is to explore ways to enhance creativity in the context of the \\nIDEAL model. \\nBefore we can explore ways to enhance creativity, it is important to \\ndefine what we mean by creativity . Some people assume that only people \\nin the performing or other arts are creative . In fact, creativity can be \\nfound in any problem-solving domain. For example, scientists can take \\ncreative approaches to constructing and testing theories, business leaders '),\n",

Furthermore, not all \\nartistic activities are creative. For examp le, drawing, sculpture, painting, \\ndance, and music can be approached noncreative ly as well as creative ly. \\nThe important point is that any task can be approached from a creative or \\na less creative point of view. \\nDavid Perkins 2 reminds us that there are degrees of creativity; it is \\nnot something that you either have or don't have. It is also important to \\ntake a reali s tic view of creativity. Many people erroneously assume that \\nsomeone is creative only if he or she is like Einstein or Bach or Picasso. \\nBut if you look for creativity only at that level of achievement you will \\nmiss the hundreds of opportunities to be creative each day. Children are \\nnaturally creative, and all adults continue to have this potential. \\nIn this book we use the term cr e ative to refer to the ability to solve \\nproblems in ways that are novel for the individual. An idea that you \\ngenerate can be creative even if you were not the first person in history \\nto think of it. What counts is your ability to approach and solve problems \\nin ways that are not routine for you. A creative idea is also one that is \\nappropriate to the situation, rather than simply novel but off the wall. As \\nwe discuss creativity within the IDEAL model, we will focus on ways to \\ngenerate ideas that are both novel and appropriate to your goals . \\nlldentifq Problems and Opportunities \\nThe ability to identify problems and opportunities is one of the most \\nimportant steps in the creative process . As an illustration, consider crea\\xad\\ntive journalists. One of their hallmarks is the ability to find important \\nissues to work on-they don't simply choose any random problem or \\ntopic. Often they write about problems that others have missed or ig\\xad\\nnored. Similarly, creative scientists often begin by finding important \\nproblems with existing theories and methods that others have failed to \\nnotice. This can lead to new, productive research that otherwise might \\nnot have been pursued. \\nWe saw in Chapter 2 that many successful inventions grow out of \\nthe process of identifying everyday problems and turning them into op\\xad\\nportunities for useful products or services . However , not all inventions \\nstem from problems that the inventor experienced personally or was the \\nfirst to identify. For example, the surgeon Henry Heimlich identified an \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='Creativit~ and the IDERL Framework .. \\nimportant problem when he read a report that choking was the sixth \\nleading cause of accidental death. Although many other doctors had \\nprobably noticed this problem , Heimlich recognized it as an opportunity \\nfor a creative solution . He soon realized that two of the recommended \\ntreatments for choking victims-removing the object with a finger and \\nslapping the victim on the back-would probably push the object deeper \\ninto the victim\\'s throat. Heimlich\\'s experience as a chest surgeon helped \\nhim realize that there would probably be enough air in the lungs to clear \\nthe victim\\'s airway if someone pushed on the diaphragm. His invention, \\nthe Heimlich maneuver, is now recognized as the best lifesaving techni\\xad\\nque for choking victims. \\nSometimes creative ideas stem from ident ifying problems in other \\npeople\\'s solutions. For example, Cal Garland noticed that the styrofoam \\nnuggets used to package delicate objects sent through the mail are bad for \\nthe environment. He realized that he could take advantage of material \\navailable at his lumberyard to provide a solution to the packaging prob\\xad\\nlem that was better for the environment. Garland patented a machine \\nthat creates curls of paper-thin wood shavings that can provide packaging \\nprotection and then be used as garden mulch. 3 \\nThe Importance of Encouraging Problem Identification \\nUnfortunately, our society often discourages people from identifying im\\xad\\nportant problems that can lead to creative solutions. In some instances, \\npeople who have attempted to identify existing or potential problems \\nhave actually been fired from their jobs . A number of tragedies in our \\nsociety might have been averted if employees had been encouraged to \\nidentify actual or potential problems. Examples include the Challenger \\nspace shuttle accident and the increased incidence of cancer from asbes\\xad\\ntos . In fact, the pressure to ignore problems in business and industry has \\nbeen strong enough to motivate the U.S. Congress to pass the Whistle\\xad\\nblowers Protection Act. The goal of this legislation is to protect people \\nwho believe that they have identified important problems. Ideally, people \\nwill come to realize more fully that the identification of problems can \\nlead to opportunities for improvements. \\nOne of us recently held a problem-solving workshop for a company \\nthat wanted to improve its operations. The workshop was designed to \\nkick off a \"quality month\" during which everyone in the company would \\ntry to find opportunities for improvement. The first week was spent \\nasking employees to identify problems in the company that, if solved, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='IIDI R Framework for Using Hnowledge More Effectivelij \\nmight improve working conditions and company operations. The most \\nimportant problems would be selected by a committee and then worked \\non by cooperative teams for the remainder of the month . The problem \\nidentification phase of the project was especially productive, and the \\nreactions of the employees were very interesting. Many mentioned that \\nnormally the act of identifying potentially solvable problems would be \\nviewed as whining or complaining. Within the context of quality month, \\nhowever, problem identification was linked with the discovery of oppor\\xad\\ntunities and so was seen as valuable . \\nOne way of using the IDEAL framework that we have found benefi\\xad\\ncial is to encourage people to identify problems in their own lives and \\nthen attempt to solve them creatively . We ask them to begin with prob\\xad\\nlems that can be solved relatively quickly. The problems that people \\nidentify in these exercises tend to be quite interesting. Participants often \\nremark that the exercise prompted them to pay much more attention to \\nannoying or troublesome events rather than simply brush them aside as \\nfacts of life. For example, college students with whom we have worked \\nhave identified problems of dormitory life such as noise from a squeaky \\nbathroom door that kept them awake (oiling it did not help), a tendency \\nto turn off alarm clocks and go back to sleep, and a shortage of parking \\nspaces. The students had noticed these problems before the IDEAL exer\\xad\\ncise, but they had not given much thought to the possibility of systemati\\xad\\ncally attempting to solve them. By actively identifying problems and \\ntreating them as opportunities for creative solutions, the students often \\nsurprised themselves and discovered that they were able to solve prob\\xad\\nlems in very interesting ways. \\nProblems with Tests of Creativit~ \\nAn emphasis on the identification of problems and opportunities as an \\nimportant step in the creative process helps clarify why it can be difficult \\nto create paper-and -pencil instruments to measure creativity. For in\\xad\\nstance, one way people have tried to assess creativity is by measuring \\n\"divergent thinking.\" A test of divergent thinking might ask people to \\ngenerate as many new uses for a brick as possible in a limited period of \\ntime. Such a test will indeed show that some people think of lots of uses \\n(for example, bookends and doorstops) while others think of fewer uses . \\nBut it is not the mere quantity of new uses that is important; it is better \\nto have a few really excellent answers than a host of mediocre ones. \\nFrom our perspective, there is something about the brick test that '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content=\"Creativit~ and the IOERL Framework E!l \\nmisses important aspects of the creative process . It explicitly asks people \\nto generate new uses for a brick, rather than measuring their ability to \\nidentify new problems and opportunities. People who can generate ideas \\non a brick test are not necessarily going to notice opportunities for inven\\xad\\ntions such as those pictured in Chapter 2. 4 \\nI Define Alternative Goals \\nThe act of defining and redefining one's goals is a particularly important \\npart of the creative process. Different goals suggest different lines of \\nthought and so have a powerful effect on the solution strategies that we \\nconsider. We saw an example of this in Chapter 2 when we discussed \\nJames Adams's bruised tomato problem . One way to define the goal in \\nthis case was to design a mechanical tomato picker that was less likely to \\nbruise tomatoes. An alternative goal was to design a tomato less likely to \\nbe bruised . \\nThe Grocer~ Store Problem \\nThe relationship between goals and creativity can be clarified by imagin\\xad\\ning a grocery store that is losing customers because they are annoyed at \\nhow long it takes to check out. If you were hired as a consultant to this \\ncompany, what would you suggest? \\nWe have given this problem to hundreds of people and find that \\nmany approach it in a very similar manner. They tend to generate solu\\xad\\ntions such as \\n• Train the cashiers to work faster. \\n• Purchase scanners and other technology to speed up the check\\xad\\nout process . \\n• Open up some cash-only lines for customers who are buying \\nonly a few items. \\n• Increase the number of checkout lines. \\nThese are all potentially good solutions. Nevertheless, they address only \\none of a number of possible general goals. That goal is to speed up the \\nprocess of getting customers through the checkout line. An alternative \\ngoal is to find ways to keep people from getting annoyed at slow checkout \\nlines . This suggests a host of potential strategies, such as installing tele-\"),\n",

This suggests strategies that are \\ndifferent from the others. One is to get more of the store's regular cus\\xad\\ntomers to come at nonpeak hours. This might be accomplished by dou\\xad\\nbling the value of coupons during certain hours of the day, having special \\nsales at certain hours, or holding special events such as services for the \\nelderly at particular hours or a singles night . \\nIn our experience with the grocery store problem, it is rare for \\npeople to step back and try to define alternative goals. Instead, most read \\nthe problem and almost immediately begin generating strategies. One \\nway that we try to help them become more creative is by asking them to \\nexplicitly define a minimum of two or three different goals for each \\nproblem situation . \\nAdditional Illustrations of the Importance of Defining Goals \\nWe have used the strategy of defining at least two goals when working \\nwith students to identify their own problems. For example, we noted \\nearlier that one problem identified by a college student was a squeaky \\nbathroom door across the hall from her dormitory room that kept her \\nawake. When she presented her problem to the class, she went beyond \\nour request for two different goals and presented the following three: \\n• To eliminate the squeak (for example, by oiling the hinge or \\nremoving the bathroom door) \\n• To keep the sound from entering the dorm room (for example, \\nby filling the space at the bottom of the dormitory door) \\n• To keep the sound from being bothersome (for example, by \\nmasking it with music or white noise) \\nAs you can see, different goals suggested different types of possible \\nstrategies . Indeed, all the students in this class generated strategies that \\nwere much more interesting and creative than those we had seen in \\nprevious classes . What was new about this class was our request that the \\nstudents generate at least two different goals to solve their problems. We \\nhad not used this instruction in previous years, and the students had not \\nspontaneously generated multiple goals on their own. \"),\n",

This point is nicely illustrated by a \\nstudent we shall call Judy who decided to write a paper on humor and \\ncame to one of us for consultation. In talking with her it became clear \\nthat her implicit goal was to describe what the \"experts\" on humor had \\nto say. Her focus was on what they say rather than on what she wanted \\nto know . Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter note that a common \\napproach to writing is to engage in knowledge telling-people simply \\nattempt to restate what they know or have read. They suggest that a \\nmuch better approach to writing is a \"knowledge transforming\" ap\\xad\\nproach. Here the goal is not simply to tell what you know or have read \\nbut to transform that knowledge in some useful way. 5 \\nTo help Judy move beyond knowledge telling, we tried to get her to \\nbetter define what she wanted to understand about humor. She was a \\nnursing major with considerable experience and we asked how the study \\nof humor might help people in the medical field. This eventually led Judy \\nto think of such ideas as laughter \\'s being the best medicine. Her goal \\neventually became much clearer: to determine whether humor is benefi\\xad\\ncial to sick people and to understand why. This approach to the problem \\nof writing her paper enabled Judy to use her own knowledge about \\nillness and the hospital setting. Furthermore, she now had a criterion for \\nevaluating the adequacy of the theories proposed by the experts in terms \\nof her goal. Needless to say, her paper turned out to be much more \\ninteresting (both to her and to us) than it would have been had she \\nsimply gone through the motions of comparing theories A, B, and C. \\nLee Bolman and Terrence Deal 8 illustrate the value of considering \\nmultiple goals when trying to develop creative ways to improve organiza\\xad\\ntions such as businesses, schools, or government agencies.

Effective problem solving requires a delicate balance between \\ngoing with the routine (because it is efficient) and taking the extra time \\nto treat a situation as nonroutine and attempting to develop a more \\ncreative approach . \\nStudies in cognitive science suggest that in many situations , routine \\nthinking and creative thinking may be complementary rather than an\\xad\\ntithetical. The reason is that people have limited attention spans, and \\nreal-world problems can easily overwhelm our processing capabilities . It \\nis difficult to be creative when one is overwhelmed . \\nRemember the experience of fir~t learning to drive a car? You had to \\nconsciously attend to particular aspects of driving such as putting on the \\nturn signal, hitting the brake and clutch, looking in the rear-view mirror \\nbefore changing lanes, and so forth. These tasks demanded so much of \\nyour attention that it was difficult to do something else simultaneously, \\nsuch as carry on a conversation with a passenger. But as these com\\xad\\nponents of driving became routine they demanded less and less attention, \\nuntil finally you could drive and carry on a conversation at the same \\ntime . In general, routine tasks support creativity because they allow us to \\nshift our attention to new aspects of a situation. \\nAs an additional example of how routine and nonroutine thinking \\ncan be complementary, imagine that you are asked to coordinate a fund\\xad\\nraising banquet and the organizer wants you to make it an especially \\nmemorable occasion. This is a complex problem that can be broken down \\ninto a number of subgoals that are routine for people who do this type of \\nthing often . These subgoals include finding a suitable location, arranging \\ndecorations, notifying and inviting guests, arranging entertainment, se\\xad\\nlecting a menu, preparing and serving food, and cleaning up. Attention to \\neach of these subgoals does not guarantee that your banquet will be \\nmemorable, but if you overlook one of them the banquet will be a flop. \\nA task such as running a fund-raising banquet requires a combina\\xad\\ntion of routine and nonroutine thinking . The more experience you have \\norganizing banquets the more likely you will be to think of all the impor\\xad\\ntant subgoals. You can then decide where to focus your creative energies. \\nPerhaps you will need special invitations , an extravagant dessert, enter\\xad\\ntainment, or an unusual theme and decorations. By first considering the \\nroutine subgoals, you will get a better idea of the creative options avail\\xad\\nable. Furthermore, each of the subgoals has a number of routine com\\xad\\nponents.

A \\nclassic experiment by Norman Maier 7 illustrates the shortcomings of \\nthinking about things in a routine rather than a novel manner. He pre\\xad\\nsented a group of people with a problem in which two cords were sus\\xad\\npended from a ceiling just far enough apart that you could not hold one \\nand reach the other (see Figure 8).

One cord \\nset swinging with the pliers attached could be grasped while you held on \\nto the other cord (see Figure 9).

For example, \\nconsider the problem of generating ideas for possible uses of bricks . \\nRather than focusing only on bricks per se, it is helpful to fractionate \\nbricks into more basic properties and consider uses for each one. Thus, a \\nbrick has a certain color and weight, is rectangular and porous, holds heat \\nbut does not conduct electricity, and is rough and small enough to be \\npicked up in one hand. \\nMost people find that fractionating the concept of a brick into \\ncomponent parts increases the number of potential uses they can \\ngenerate. Furthermore, when people try to generate uses but do not \\nemploy the strategy of thinking about individual properties of bricks, \\ntheir responses usually reflect assumptions about those properties. For \\nexample, a person who thinks of doorstops, paperweights, and bookends \\nas uses for bricks is probably, without necessarily realizing it, thinking \\nabout the property of weight. \\nHere is another problem. \\nConsider ways to reduce the sound from highways. \\nBreaking this problem into its components can also help you generate \\nnovel ideas. For example, you might first think of the factors involved in \\nthe problem; that is, roads, cars and trucks, people (presumably the ones \\nbothered by noise), and some medium (such as air) that carries sound. \\nYou could then think about the individual properties of each. For ex\\xad\\nample, people have ears that might be covered to reduce the perception \\nof noise, cars and trucks have tires that might affect the level of noise, and \\nso forth . Such thinking can facilitate our access to ideas that may lead to \\ncreative solutions. \\nThe Use of Rnalogies \\nSearching for analogies is another strategy for enhancing creative think\\xad\\ning. For example, John Hayes describes a meeting on the problem of '),\n",

In the past, discussion had focused only on conventional housing \\nsuch as dorms, which are expensive to build and impossible to move \\naround . \\nAnalogies have played a key role in discoveries in science and tech\\xad\\nnology. For example, Benjamin Franklin noticed that a pointed object \\nwould draw a much stronger spark than a blunt object in the vicinity of \\nan electrified body.l 1 At first he thought this was an unimportant obser\\xad\\nvation. Until he recognized the analogy between clouds and electrified \\nbodies, he did not realize that pointed rods of iron could be used to \\nprotect buildings and ships from damage by lightning. Similarly, Gut en\\xad\\nberg\\'s invention of the printing press was developed in part out of anal\\xad\\nogies he saw with the wine press and the punches used for making coins. \\nAnother illustration of the key role analogies can play in great dis\\xad\\ncoveries is provided in the reflections of August Wilhelm Kekule written \\n25 years after he published his model for the structure of the benzene \\nmolecule. 12 \\nI turned my chair to the fire and dozed . . .. Again the atoms were gamboll\\xad\\ning before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the back\\xad\\nground. My mental eye , rendered more acute by repeated visions of this \\nkind , could now distinguish larger structures , of manifold conformation; \\nlong rows , sometimes more closely fitted together; all twining and twisting \\nin snakelike motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had \\nseized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes . \\nUsing the analogy of a snake biting its own tail, Kekule developed a \\nmodel for the ringlike structure of the benzene molecule that profoundly \\naffected the science of organic chemistry . \\nIn addition to facilitating the discovery of new ideas and the crea\\xad\\ntion of new inventions, analogies provide alternative frameworks for \\ninterpreting familiar facts. For example, in a recent period of stock\\xad\\nmarket decline, one analyst criticized the gloomy predictions of most of \\nhis colleagues and argued instead that the market would experience a \\nsubstantial gain. His reasoning was based on an analogy with a diving \\nboard-the more downward pressure placed on a diving board, the \\ngreater the tendency for it to push back upward. We question the ap-'),\n",

Even imperfect analogies may sometimes be \\nuseful if they lead to creative solutions. The effect of analogic thinking on \\ncreativity was perhaps best expressed by William Gordon when he said \\nthat analogies make the strange familiar and the familiar strange. 13 Both \\nincrease the probability that we will think about things in new rather \\nthan routine ways. \\nBrainstorming \\nIn 1957, Alexander Osborn described the concept of brainstorming . 14 His \\ngoal was to use a group setting to increase the production of creative \\nideas. One of the most important characteristics of a brainstorming ses\\xad\\nsion is that participants adopt an attitude of complete friendliness and an \\nopenness to suggestions . At first, wild ideas are encouraged-the wilder \\nthe better. Further, members of the brainstorming group must agree to \\nwithhold their evaluation of ideas until later in the session; criticism is \\ntherefore ruled out . This rule is extremely important. Since novel ideas \\noften differ from conventional wisdom, premature evaluations can \\nprevent one from appreciating their value. Premature evaluations in \\nbrainstorming sessions are often referred to as \"idea killers\" because they \\nhinder creative \\nthought. \\nA variation on brainstorming is to ask group members to write \\ndown their ideas on sheets of paper and then exchange them so that \\nothers can make modifications and suggestions. This procedure, called \\nbrainwriting, has sometimes been found to be even more effective than \\nbrainstorming. 15 \\nWriting as a Discoverq Technique \\nAnother strategy for discovering new ideas is to explore a topic in writing. \\nSince written language persists over time, written ideas can be subjected \\nto more intense scrutiny . Writing is often thought to be a way of express\\xad\\ning ideas rather than creating new insights. That people should think this \\nis probably a reflection of the way society and educational institutions \\ntypically view writing and communication skills. Usually they are taught \\nindependently of subjects such as physics, psychology, and mathematics . \\nHowever , many experienced writers, speakers, and researchers say that \\nthe development of ideas occurs to a great degree during the process of \\nputting ideas into a communicable form . '),\n",

We knew that we wanted to have a section on the \\nuse of analogies, and because we assumed that all uses of analogy were \\nsimilar, we thought that one section on analogies would be adequate . As \\nwe began writing, however, it became clear that analogies can be used \\nin very different ways . For example, they are often used as a basis for \\narguments (see Chapter 4) . Earlier in this chapter, we also argued that \\nanalogies can be used to facilitate the generation of new ideas, and in a \\nlater chapter we discuss how they can help in the communication of \\nideas. In retrospect , these different uses of analogies seem obvious to us, \\nbut they were not obvious before . Writing and other forms of commu\\xad\\nnication (such as teaching) help us discover ideas and distinctions of \\nwhich we were not at first aware . \\nIncubation \\nIn the preceding discussion we assumed that one continues to work on a \\nproblem until it is solved. However, if you have ever worked on a difficult \\nproblem for some length of time (on ideas for a speech or paper, for \\nexample) you have probably found that, at some point, you had to stop \\nthinking about it for a while. This is not merely because of mental fatigue; \\noften one is able to think about other things. Instead, the reason for \\nstopping is that the same old answers keep coming up. People get locked \\ninto a particular way of thinking and need to break out . \\nThe term incubation refers to something that happens during the \\nperiod when one has stopped working on a problem. For example, some \\npeople purposely think about a problem before going to bed so they can \\nsleep on it. They hope that ideas will incubate (hatch) during the night \\nand fresh insights will be available when they wake up. And indeed, this \\nsometimes seems to occur. Many scientists have written about having \\nflashes of insight after they stopped thinking about a problem and did \\nsomething else (took a trip, read a novel, or slept). 16 The following quo\\xad\\ntation is from the French mathematician Henri Poincare . 17 \\nOne evening contrary to my custom, I drank black coffee and could not \\nsleep . Ideas rose in crowds ; I felt them collide until pairs interlocked , so to \\nspeak, making a stable combination. By the next morning , I had estab\\xad\\nlished the existence of a class of Fuchsian functions , those which come from \\nthe hyp e rgeometric series ; I had only to write out the results, which took \\nbut a few hours . '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 75}, page_content='Creativit~ and the IDEAL Framework .. \\nIn Poincare\\'s case, a great deal of preparation preceded the insight; \\nhe had spent a large amount of time working on his problem. The same \\nis true for other scientists who have reported the role of insight in their \\nwork. The entire process has been broken down into four phases : ( l) \\npreparation, when you work hard on a problem and understand it; (2) \\nincubation, when you stop working on the problem; ( 3) illumination, \\nwhen a new insight occurs; and ( 4) elaboration, when the implications of \\nthe insight are worked out. \\nAn interesting question is \"What happens during incubation?\" One \\nanswer is that the unconscious mind works on the problem . A weakness \\nof this view is that we don\\'t know what the unconscious mind is or does. \\nNevertheless, if you believe that the unconscious does its best work when \\nit is not interfered with by the conscious mind, then the best procedure is \\nprobably to avoid thinking about the problem you want to solve, perhaps \\nby going to sleep. \\nAnother view of the benefits of incubation is that , with time, we \\ncease making implicit assumptions that are preventing an adequate solu\\xad\\ntion. Land, the inventor of the Polaroid Land Camera, once described \\ninsight as \"the sudden cessation of stupidity.\\'\\' 18 This is consistent with the \\nview that incubation helps us stop making inappropriate assumptions. \\nLike the unconscious process theory, this view of insight suggests that we \\nnot think about the problem during the incubation phase. However, this \\nview also suggests that during the preparation phase of problem solving \\nwe should try to make our assumptions as explicit as possible to increase \\nthe likelihood that alternatives will emerge . \\nStill another view of incubation is that it enables us to process new \\ninformation that may provide a clue for a solution . When problem sol\\xad\\nvers focus only on the problem to be solved, they may miss information \\nthat could serve as clues . However, if they keep the problem in the back \\nof their minds while doing other things, they may increase the probability \\nof encountering useful clues. \\nConsider the following list of words and phrases: \\nCowbell \\nChopsticks \\nTrumpet \\nRoof \\nTree '),\n",

This time, items on \\nthe list (such as chopsticks) may provide a clue for problem solution.l 9 If \\nyou had kept working on the problem you probably would not have read \\nthe list. Furthermore, if the problem had not been in the back of your \\nmind, the insight afforded by the word chopsticks would not have oc\\xad\\ncurred to you. \\nCharles Darwin notes that while trying to develop a theory that \\nwould account for the data he had collected on similarities and dis\\xad\\nsimilarities among different species, he happened to read an essay by \\nThomas Malthus on population. 20 According to Darwin, the essay helped \\nhim formulate the theory of evolution despite the fact that it was about a \\ndifferent topic. Had Darwin simply sat in his room pondering the data, he \\nmight not have read Malthus\\'s article . And if Darwin had not kept the \\ngeneral problem of accounting for his data in the back of his mind, \\nMalthus\\'s work would not have had the clue value it did. \\nThis perspective on incubation suggests that we can take an active \\nrole, rather than merely sleeping or not thinking about a problem. We \\ncan talk with others, read books, look at magazines, view scenery, and so \\nforth. If we keep the problem in the back of our mind, we may find a host \\nof clues that can help us generate creative ideas. \\nCreativit~ Checklists \\nAnother way to increase our ability to access knowledge and experiences \\nthat might be relevant to a problem is by using special lists designed to \\nhelp people get around the constraints of routine thinking. Like frac\\xad\\ntionation, creativity checklists are meant to expand the range of experi\\xad\\nences and strategies that we consider during problem solving. Alexander \\nOsborn 21 created one of the more famous creativity lists. \\nCreativity checklists can be useful in helping us get beyond routine \\nthinking.

For instance, we noted earlier that functional fixedness and \\nlearning set can prevent people from solving a problem because they \\nassume that it requires routine thinking. In many situations we are un\\xad\\naware or unwilling to admit that we are making certain assumptions. \\nThese assumptions may guide our behavior and thoughts without our \\nknowing it. For instance, a male business executive who is unaware of \\nhis belief that women cannot be effective managers may be biased in \\nfavor of hiring only male managers. One strategy that psychologists have \\nused to uncover such biases or assumptions is to get people to make \\npredictions or anticipate outcomes. Thus, we could ask the business ex\\xad\\necutive to predict the success of two job applicants by looking at resumes \\n.that were identical in every way except gender. Predictions like these \\ncould be used to uncover other assumptions that might bias jurors, pa\\xad\\ntients, voters, and others. \\nAnticipating outcomes can also help us to uncover fundamental \\nassumptions in other areas. For example, to probe peop le's understand\\xad\\ning of certain fundamental laws of physics, the researcher Michael \"),\n",

To explore the use of predictions and \\nthought experiments further, try to imagine what the observer would see \\nif the streetcar were traveling faster than the speed of light (the answer \\nappears in Appendix A). \\nThe Importance of Anticipating Positive as Well as Negative Outcomes \\nThe opposite of failing to anticipate problems that may arise from new \\nideas is thinking too narrowly and failing to anticipate the good that can \\ncome from them. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Chester Carlson \\napproached numerous companies with a new idea for copying docu\\xad\\nments that was based on the principles of photoconductivity and electro\\xad\\nstatics . All but one of the companies rejected his idea. One of the reasons \\ngiven was that office workers already had an effective method-carbon \\npaper-for making multiple copies of documents. Many thought there \\nwould be little demand for an expensive machine that performed virtual\\xad\\nly the same function. Others found fault with the quality of the image \\nthat Carlson's machine produced. 25 \\nThose early criticisms of the invention assumed that the new rna\\xad\\nchine's primary consequence would be to replace carbon paper and that \\nthe quality of the image it produced could not be improved . In fact, \\nCarlson's invention had applications that went far beyond the purpose of \\ncarbon paper. For example, his machine could be used to duplicate docu\\xad\\nments and graphic images that were prepared in other offices, making it \\nunnecessary to retype or redraw them . Unlike carbon paper, the copy \\nmachine could also produce a large number of copies with the same \\nimage quality. \\nThe problems that Carlson experienced gaining acceptance for his \\nmachine demonstrate how easy it is to find fault with any new idea or \\ninvention. It is therefore important to look back at initial criticisms and \\ndetermine whether they are based on inappropriate assumptions . For \\nexample, in Carlson's case the copy machine had many more applications \\nthan the critics thought. Similarly, it is important to determine whether a \\nnew idea or invention can be modified to overcome a fault. In the case of \\nthe copy machine, the quality of the image was greatly improved in \\nsubsequent development work. Carlson's invention (xerography) quickly \\nbecame a big success for the Haloid Corporation (now the Xerox Cor\\xad\\nporation), and modern versions of the machine are a part of almost every \\noffice environment. \"),\n",

To install phone lines in \\neach of the classrooms involved in the project would have been quite \\nexpensive. \\nThe question of who to talk with to help anticipate the effects of \\nvarious ideas is very important. In the previous example, our tendency \\nwas to talk only with computer experts, since that was the technology we \\nwere implementing. If we had not talked to the classroom teachers, we \\nwould have failed to realize that the lack of phone lines in the classroom \\nwas a problem. People often convene focus groups without thinking \\nmuch about whom to include. If you choose people with very different \\nkinds of experiences, there will be a much higher probability of getting \\nfeedback that will save you from costly mistakes later on. \\nIt can also be important to have focus groups work with actual \\nprototypes rather than simply to imagine a new idea. The more concrete \\nthe prototype and the more realistic the setting for its use, the higher the \\nprobability that potential problems will be found and fixed. \\nA Checklist That Can Facilitate the Anticipation of Consequences \\nSidney Parnes and Harold Harding discuss checklists such as the one \\nbelow that can be helpful in anticipating the effects of new ideas and \\nproducts. 26 You might want to modify this list to suit your own problems . \\nl. Effects on your objective? \\n2. Individuals and/or groups affected? \\n3. Costs involved? \\n4. Tangibles involved (material, equipment, etc.)? \\n5. Moral or legal implications? '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 81}, page_content='Creativitq and the IDEAL Framework .. \\n6. Intangibles involved (opinions, attitudes, feelings, aesthetic \\nvalues, etc.)? \\n7. New problems caused? \\n8. Difficulties of implementation and follow-up? \\n9. Repercussions of failure \\n10 . Timelines, etc.? \\nFor any problem, these questions can be answered in terms of both \\npotential negative and positive outcomes. In fact, an effective approach to \\nanticipating outcomes is to imagine both worst-case scenarios and best\\xad\\ncase scenarios. As these are imagined (and sometimes acted out) in detail, \\nwe find that a number of ideas are considered that otherwise would not \\ncome to mind. Our suggestions are consistent with Edward deBono\\'s PMI \\n(plus, minus, interesting) strategy . He suggests that creativity can be en\\xad\\nhanced if we consider the \"plus\" aspects of an idea, the \"minus\" aspects, \\nand the points that seem \"interesting.\" 27 Creative problem solvers often \\nget new insights during the anticipate phase of problem solving. These \\ninsights can reveal new opportunities and problems that were previously \\noverlooked. \\nI ~ook and ~earn \\nLong-term efforts to enhance your creativity will not be successful unless \\nyou actively look at the effects of your actions and attempt to learn from \\nthem. Furthermore, you need to look at them from the perspective of \\nlearning something general about enhancing creativity. For example, im\\xad\\nagine that you have failed to anticipate some effect of a new idea and \\ndiscover it only after trying out the idea. You may have developed a novel \\nway to make a presentation to a group of people, for example, and found \\nthat it fell flat because the audience expected something much more \\nconventional. What do you do? \\nA natural reaction is to feel awful and to put the situation out of \\nyour mind and get on with other work. But failure can be an excellent \\nteacher. We have therefore learned to ask such questions as \"What as\\xad\\nsumptions were being made about the situation that were erroneous?\" \\nand \"How could we have gotten the right kind of feedback in advance by \\nusing the right people for the situation?\" As we explore these questions, \\nwe develop ideas about improving our ability to be both novel and ap\\xad\\npropriate .

Another important part of looking back at our \\nproblem-solving strategies is to examine implicit assumptions that might \\ninterfere with creative problem solving. For an illustration of how certain \\nassumptions can interfere with creativity, try to solve the following puz\\xad\\nzles as quickly as possible: \\nI. A superpsychic can predict the score of any game before it begins. \\nHow is this possible? \\n2. Two men played five games of checkers. Each won three games. \\nPlease explain. \\n3. Add one line to IX to make six. \\nMost people have a difficult time solving these verbal puzzles, especially \\nthe first and third . The reason is that they are making assumptions that \\nblock the solutions . \\nConsider the first problem. You probably assumed that the super\\xad\\npsychic could predict the final score of any game. But the question really \\nasks about the score of any game before it begins. Once you make this \\nassumption about the score to be predicted the answer is easy: zero to \\nzero. \\nIn the second problem, you probably assumed that the two men \\nplayed each other. Once you realize that this assumption is unnecessary, \\nthe problem is easy to solve . \\nThe third problem is difficult for people who assume that they must \\nrestrict themselves to working with roman numerals and that a line is \\nnecessarily straight line. The problem becomes much simpler when you \\nbreak out of these assumptions . You can add a curved line (an S) to IX to \\nmake SIX. \\nThe idea of examining routine assumptions that are taken for \\ngranted is important in all areas of inquiry . As an illustration, consider the \\nCopernican revolution . Copernicus was a careful and creative scientist \\nwho eventually solved a problem that others before him had failed to \\nsolve: how to account for the irregular movements of the planets in the \\nheavens. Astronomers had collected data indicating where various plan\\xad\\nets were at particular points in time (for example, during different \\nmonths), but no one had been able to come up with a satisfying theory \\nthat explained why planetary movement appeared to deviate from the '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='Creativit~ and the IDEHL Framework .. \\nregular paths that were predicted. 28 After years of study, Copernicus \\nfinally created a theory that nicely explained the apparently irregular \\nmovements of the planets. To do so, however, he had to make a radical \\nassumption. Before Copernicus, everyone had taken for granted that the \\nsun and the other planets revolve around the Earth, and indeed, it looks \\nthat way to the naked eye. Copernicus argued that this assumption made \\nit impossible to explain the movement of the planets. His theory began \\nwith the alternative assumption that the Earth and the other planets \\nrevolve around the sun. This assumption was considered absurd and so \\nradical that Copernicus was condemned by the Catholic Church. \\nSeveral lessons can be learned from the example of Copernicus. One \\nis that unnecessary assumptions (that the sun and the other planets \\nrevolve around the Earth) can make it impossible to solve a problem. We \\nhave discussed this point before, but it is so important that it bears repeat\\xad\\ning. Another is that it is easy to overlook basic assumptions that reduce \\nthe creativity of our responses to problems. \\nPeople who work with business executives have noted an assump\\xad\\ntion that keeps many of them from exploring new avenues for training \\nand employment. The assumption is that one is too old to try something \\nnew. David Schwartz describes a 40-year-old man, Cecil, who wanted to \\nreceive training for a better job but felt that he was too old. 29 A common \\nresponse to this type of problem is to suggest that \"you are only as old as \\nyou feel\" or to say something like, \"Ruth and Jim changed jobs at your \\nage and look at how well they are doing.\" The problem with such sugges\\xad\\ntions is that people often feel old because they believe they are old. It is \\nalso easy to see Ruth and Jim as special cases whose situations differ in \\nimportant ways from one\\'s own. \\nSchwartz approached the prob l em in a way that directly challenged \\nCecil\\'s basic assumptions. He asked Cecil to say when a productive career \\nbegan (\"About 20\" was the answer) and then when such a career usually \\nends (\"Between 65 and 70\"). Schwartz thus helped Cecil to realize that, \\nat 40, he hadn\\'t even approached the halfway point of his career. \\nSearching tor Inconsistencies \\nOur discussion of Copernicus illustrates a general strategy that can \\nprompt an examination of basic assumptions-the strategy of searching \\nfor inconsistencies. Copernicus wanted to create a theory that explained \\nirregularities in the movements of the planets, but his initial attempts \\nresulted in theories that were inconsistent with the actual data. His con-'),\n",

H Framework tor Using Hnowledge More Effectivelu \\ntinued failure to formulate a successful theory eventually served as a \\nsignal that some of his assumptions must be erroneous. Had Copernicus \\nnot cared about formulating a precise theory consistent with all the data, \\nthe need to question basic assumptions would probably never have oc\\xad\\ncurred to him. \\nThe strategy of searching for inconsistencies is also used by efficient \\ntechnicians, doctors, and others when they are trying to evaluate their \\ndiagnoses of a problem. For example, a particular problem (a dead bat\\xad\\ntery) usually has an associated set of symptoms (the engine won't start or \\nturns over slowly, or the lights are dim). If the observed facts are not \\nconsistent with these symptoms (the lights are very bright even though \\nthe motor won't start), there is reason to doubt or reject the diagnosis of \\na dead battery. People often fail to evaluate the adequacy of their as\\xad\\nsumptions because they do not notice their inconsistency with observed \\nfacts. For example, in the next paragraph the implicit assumption is \\ninconsistent with certain facts. See if you can identify those facts. \\nI left work at 4:30 P . M. on Friday and got caught in the usual rush-hour \\ntraffic. When I arrived home I decided to take a shower before preparing \\nfor my trip that weekend. After packing my clothes and putting food out \\nfor the cat I decided to make a sandwich . To my horror the refrigerator \\nwas not working. Since I would be gone all weekend it was important to \\nget it fixed before leaving early next morning. I immediately looked in the \\nphone book and called the only refrigerator repair service. Unfortunate\\xad\\nly, no one answered the phone . This was very aggravating since the adver\\xad\\ntisement said it was open until 5 P.M. Monday through Friday and the \\nclock on my kitchen wall showed it to be 20 minutes before 5. In \\ndesperation, I went out and bought a new refrigerator at the all-night \\ndepartment store. \\nDid you notice any facts that appeared inconsistent with the \\nproblem's being specific to the refrigerator? That the clock in the kitchen \\nread 4:40, which is only 10 minutes from the time the person left work \\n(and took a shower, packed, and fed the cat), could indicate that the \\nelectrical power in the kitchen was not operating properly. To evaluate \\nfurther the assumption that the problem was localized in the refrigerator, \\nit would have been helpful to check other appliances in the kitchen and \\nthe circuit-breaker panel. By searching for inconsistencies between what \\nwe observe and what we assume to be true, we can discover assumptions \"),\n",

Different ways of reentering the IDEAL cycle are more \\nor less creative . A less creative approach may be to see that something \\ndoesn't work (the look and learn part of the cycle) and then to try again \\nwith only a small change in procedure . A more creative approach may be \\nto rethink one's assumptions and redefine the problem from a very dif\\xad\\nferent point of view. \\nEdward deBono 30 distinguishes between vertical thinking (proceed\\xad\\ning systematically from a single concept or definition) and lateral think\\xad\\ning (seeking alternative ways of defining or interpreting a problem). He \\nstates: \\nLogic is th e tool that is us e d to dig holes deeper and bigger, to make them \\naltogether b e tter holes . But if the hole is in the wrong place , then no \\namount of improvement is going to put it in the right place. No matter how \\nobvious this may seem to every digger, it is still easier to go on digging in \\nthe same place than to start all over again in a new place. Vertical think\\xad\\ning is digging the same hole deeper; lateral thinking is trying again else \\xad\\nwhere . \\nThese comments suggest that an important aspect of creative problem \\nsolving is to ask yourself whether you are making assumptions about the \\nnature of a problem that are limiting your ability to find solutions . \\nDuring an afternoon seminar on problem solving that one of us was \\nteaching, a bird flew through the open window and fluttered frantically \\naround the room. It was possible that the bird might be injured or people \\ncould get hurt. The teacher announced that this was a real-world prob\\xad\\nlem to be solved. (What else could he do, given that the seminar was on \\nproblem solving?) Fortunately for the teacher, he was eventually able to \\nsolve the problem. \\nIn considering his thought processes, the teacher realized that he \\nwas not successful until he had moved through the IDEAL cycle several \\ntimes and had reformulated some of his initial definitions of the problem. \"),\n",

Approximately two minutes \\nafter t he bird entered the room, the teacher redefined the goal as \"How \\ncan I get the bird to leave the room?\" This led to a strategy that worked \\non the first try (see Appendix A). \\nI Summarq \\nCreativity is the ability to generate ideas and that are both novel and \\nappropriate. Everyone is creative to some degree, and we can all improve \\nour ability in this area. From the perspective of the IDEAL framework, \\nefforts to enhance creativity involve each component of IDEAL . \\nA hallmark of creative individuals is their ability to identify impor\\xad\\ntant problems and opportunities that others have missed or taken for \\ngranted. Tests of divergent thinking do not tap this ability and hence miss \\na very important aspect of creative behavior. By actively attempting to \\nidentify important problems and opportunities, people can enhance their \\ncreativity. \\nCreativity can also be enhanced by learning to define a minimum of \\ntwo different goals for any problem, rather than jumping right to the \\ngeneration of possible solution strategies, as most people do. Attention to \\ngoals helps us uncover a host of unexamined assumptions that can block \\nour ability to think in nonroutine ways. \\nOnce goals are defined, there \\nare a variety of strategies for thinking \\nmore creatively about them. Examples include the use of the PMI (plus, \\nminus, interesting) strategy, the fractionation strategy, analogies, creativ\\xad\\nity checklists, brainstorming, and incubation (sleeping on the problem). \\nIt is important not to evaluate ideas prematurely, because evaluations can \\nact as idea killers that hamper nonroutine thought. \\nSince the goa l of being creative is to generate ideas and behave in \\nways that are both novel and appropriate, it is very important to an\\xad\\nticipate the effects of implementing novel strategies. There are many \\nstrategies that enhance the probability of anticipating both negative and \\npositive outcomes that might otherwise be unforeseen. \\nThe ability to be creative depends in part on our ability to make \\naspects of complex problems routine so that our attention is not over\\xad\\nwhe lmed. If you look at a situation and decide that your responses were \\nnot as creative as you desired, it can be helpful to ask whether part of the \\nproblem is that you were overwhelmed by the complexity of the task.

It is often difficult for us to \\nimagine people accepting ideas that would justify killing millions of peo\\xad\\nple in the Holocaust or blowing up an airplane full of innocent civilians. \\nWilliam Dember notes that it is fashionable to think that the perpetrators \\nof such atrocities were people whose \"emotions overshadowed their \\nthinking.\" But Dember suggests that we consider the opposite conclu\\xad\\nsion: that ideology came to rule their emotions. 2 In fact, numerous ex\\xad\\namples of atrocities committed in almos t all societies are difficu lt to \\nattribute to emotion. For examp le, the U.S . government forced Nat ive \\nAmericans to give up much of the land their ancestors had occupied for \\ncenturies. Many of the Native Americans who refused were killed by \\nsoldiers. More recently, the U.S. government interned thousan d s of \\nAmerican citizens of Japanese ancestry during World War II. These ac\\xad\\ntions were justified on the basis of a political and economic ideology that \\nstressed the importance of protecting the country and allow ing it to grow. \\nThe powerful effects that ideology can have on peop le\\'s actions and \\ntheir sense of right and wrong has been noted by many observers . For \\nexample, Arthur Koestler states: 3 \\nWe are thus driven to the unfashionable conclusion that the trouble with \\nour species is not an excess of aggression, but an excess capacity for fanati\\xad\\ncal devotion . Even a cursory glance at history should convince one that in\\xad\\ndividual crimes committed for selfish motives play a quite insignificant \\npart in the human tragedy , compared to the numbers massacred in unsel\\xad\\nfish loyalty to one \\'s tribe , nation , dynasty , church or political ideology. \\nIDER~ and the Evaluation of Rrguments \\nThroughout t h is chapter we will examine how to u se the IDEAL \\nframework to think about and eva luate argumen t s critica ll y.

Near the end of the \\ntrial, the defense lawyer tried to convince the jury that the defendant was '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 96}, page_content=\".. H F ramework for U si ng Hnowledge More Effe c tivelq \\ninnocent. He reminded the jury that the argument of the prosecuting \\nattorney was based on circumstantial evidence and argued that a trial of \\nthis type is like a chain. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and \\nthe defense lawyer said that the jury needed a strong chain to convict the \\ndefendant. He then proceeded to show not only one weak link in the \\nchain, but several. \\nImagine that you are the prosecuting attorney in this trial. You \\nspeak to the jury after the defense finishes its presentation. To convince \\nthe jury that the defendant is guilty, you need to do more than com\\xad\\nprehend what the defense lawyer has said to the jury. You also need to \\ncriticize his argument and communicate your ideas clearly and persua\\xad\\nsively. \\nThere are several ways to evaluate arguments. One is to focus on \\nfactua l accuracy. For example, the defense attorney may have stated \\n(erroneously) that a jury may not reach a guilty verdict on the basis of \\ncircumstantial evidence alone. Given this argument, you could challenge \\nthe accuracy of the defense attorney's facts. \\nA second way is to determine whether the reasoning is logical and \\nconsistent. A person may begin with accurate facts, but the conclusion \\ndrawn may be invalid. For example if the defendant drinks beer and a \\nwine bottle was found near the victim, this does not prove that the \\ndefendant is innocent. \\nA third way to evaluate an argument is to question its underlying \\nassumptions. The facts may be correct and the arguments sound only \\ngiven the truth of various assumptions. However, a creative person may \\nbe able to come up with a set of assumptions that differ from those made \\npreviously . In the California trial, for example, Bugliosi questioned a \\nbasic assumption made by the defense attorney: He argued that trials \\nbased on circumstantial evidence are analogous to a rope rather than a \\nchain. A rope is composed of a number of independent strands; several of \\nthese can break without having much effect on the overall strength of the \\nrope. Bugliosi acknowledged that there were indeed a few questionable \\nstrands, but he emphasized that the rest of the evidence was more than \\nstrong enough to convict the defendant. (For what it's worth, Bugliosi \\nwon the case.) \\nI The nnal~sis of Factual Claims \\nSuppose you win $10,000 in a contest and want to invest the money . An \\ninvestment counselor offers you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: He \"),\n",

You e x amine the coin and observe that it indeed looks \\nauthentic. The counselor emphasizes that since the coin is very old (the \\ndate stamped on it is 42 B.c.), it should be worth at least what you are \\nbeing asked to pay (which is $9100) . He also explains that the seller is \\nwilling to part with the coin at this low price only because he needs the \\nmoney immediately and it usually takes about a month to sell an antique \\ncoin at its fair value . Would you buy the coin? Why or why not? \\nIf you dedded to buy the coin you also bought a faulty argument. \\nOne of the facts used to support the claim that the coin is ancient cannot \\nbe true. To stamp a coin 42 B .c., the coin maker would have had to know \\nin advance not only the exact year of the birth of Christ , but also that his \\nbirth would be the basis for dating in the future. Since this is extremely \\ndoubtful, the coin clearly is a fake. \\nA claim that a coin was minted in 42 B.c. is not necessarily false. It \\nis possible to find a coin this old. The problem with the argument is not \\nthe claim itself but the evidence for the claim (that the date was printed on \\nthe coin). Geologists and archaeologists make claims about the age of \\nvarious entities (fossils and skeletons), but they do so by providing \\nevidence that seems reasonable given current scientific knowledge (they \\noften use radioactive isotopes to date items). Effective critics pay careful \\nattention to the nature of the evidence on which claims are based. 5 \\nInvited Inferences That Do Not Follow from the Data \\nYou can learn a lot about the importance of paying attention to data by \\nstudying advertisements. By law, advertisers cannot lie; for example, it \\nwould be illegal to advertise that a coin stamped 42 B .C . is authentic . \\nNevertheless, advertisements often prompt us to make \"invited inferen\\xad\\nces\" about messages that, from a logical or scientific perspective, do not \\nfollow. Consider the following claim . \\nScientific studies show that our brand (brand A) is unsurpassed by any \\nother brand on the market . \\nHow do you interpret this statement? Many people assume that brand A \\nhas been shown to be superior to other brands. This is only an invited \\ninference , however. Legally , \"unsurpassed\" means that the researchers \\nhave found no differences in the effectiveness of brand A versus other \\nbrands. \\nHere is another example of a possible claim. '),\n",

For example, a motor provides an alternative \\nmeans of transportation in case of an accident like a broken arm or a torn \\nsail; also, a motor allows one to travel faster and hence avoid such \\nproblems as storms and high winds. In general, people think the data \\nshow that boats with motors are safer than boats without motors. This state\\xad\\nment, therefore, appears to be a fact. \\nIf you think about it, however, you will recognize a problem with \\nthis \"factual\" statement, which is that there are many differences be\\xad\\ntween boats besides the presence or absence of motors. For example, \\nwhite-water canoes would never have a motor, whereas canoes used on \\ncalm lakes (which are generally safer than fast-moving streams) would \\nbe much more likely to have one. And only the larger sailboats (those less \\nlikely to capsize) are likely to have motors. Finally, inexperienced sailors \\nare more likely to have smaller, less stable boats. Given these considera\\xad\\ntions, it is questionable that motors alone account for differences in \\nsafety. Indeed, in many situations (such as canoeing on a fast river or \\nsailing a small boat on a windy lake) it seems that the presence of a motor \\ncould make a boat less safe . \\nMany types of claims are based on similar types of data. For ex\\xad\\nample: \\nAt a meeting of educators, a committee chairman reported on a study \\nthat had just been completed. Questionnaires had been sent to teachers; \\ntwo of the questions asked were: \"How much do you like computers?\" \\nand \"How much experience have you had with computers?\" The data \\nshowed that the people who claimed to have had the most experience \\nwith computers also liked them better. Based on these data, the chairman \\ndrew the following conclusion: \"We can see that the more people are ex\\xad\\nposed to computers the more they will like them.\" '),\n",

Nevertheless , the data \\npresented by the committee chairman do not really support this claim. \\nThe chairman is suggesting that experience with compu t ers causes people \\nto like them . But the opposite is also possible; namely, that people who \\nlike computers are apt to seek to learn more about them, and such people \\ntherefore have more experience with them . It is the degree of liking that \\ncauses the contact with computers . \\nThe data do not allow us to conclude that liking causes contact with \\ncomputers, that contact causes liking , or that each affects the other. The \\nreason is that the data involve only correlations between two variables. \\nEvidence for a correlation between variables (liking and contact with \\ncomputers or motors on boats and safety) does not necessarily include \\nevidence that either variable causes the other. Indeed, both might be \\ncaused by a third variable. For example, it is not difficult to find a positive \\ncorrelation between increases in teacher salaries and increases in alcohol \\nconsumption. This doesn't necessarily mean that teachers use the addi\\xad\\ntional money to buy liquor. Instead, the correlation is probably due to \\nsome third variable that affects raises as well as consumption . A likely \\ncandidate would be growth in the general economy which would allow \\nschools to pay teachers more and increase the disposable income of other \\npeople as well. \\nCorrelation Versus Cause and Effect \\nThe preceding discussion illustrates a common mistake in reasoning: Cor\\xad\\nrelational data are often interpret e d as indicating cause and effect . There are \\ntimes, however, when it is valid to conclude that one thing is caused or \\naffected by another. It is important to understand the nature of the \\nevidence necessary to make such a claim . For example, what kinds of \\ndata would provide convincing evidence that as people's contacts with \\ncomputers increase, they like computers more? 7 The fo ll owing para \\xad\\ngraphs illustrate one approac h to this prob lem. \\nImagine that 10 0 people are randomly assigned to two groups.

Second, it \\nsuggests that any type of experience with computers (learning to program in \\nBASIC as well as playing video games) is equally likely to increase liking.

However, this claim is not supported by the \\ndata presented.

That is, what must we do to ensure that our conclusions follow \\nlogically from a set of premises or facts? 8 \\nHere is a claim that seems to be supported by the study of history: \\n\" Many scientific theories that later proved valid were first ridiculed.\" In '),\n",

You are un\\xad\\ndoubtedly familiar with a very simple if-then statement known as a \\nguarantee: \"If you are not satisfied with our product, [then] we will \\nrefund your money.\" Another example is insurance policies: \"If you have \\na car accident, we will pay for damages.\" The if-then statement is used to \\ndescribe a relationship between two events; it tells us what shou ld hap\\xad\\npen (we will be able to get our money back) if certain events (we are not \\nsatisfied with the product) occur. Each if-then argument includes what is \\ncalled an antecedent (if you are not satisfied with our product) and a \\nconsequent (we will refund your money) . When we are given a clear if\\xad\\nthen statement and find the antecedent condition to be true (we are not \\nsatisfied with the product), we can rightfully expect the consequent con\\xad\\ndition also to be true (we will to get our money back).

The murder did occur \\nduring this time; therefore, my client is innocent.\" The general form of \\nthis argument is \"If A, then B; A, therefore B.\" This is a valid argument. \\nSuppose we try to reverse the argument. That is, if the client is truly \\ninnocent, can we conclude that the murder therefore took place at the \\ntime of his alibi; that is, between 9 and 12 A.M.? The answer is no; the \\nmurder could have taken place at any number of times. The form of this \\nargument is \"If A, then B; B, therefore A.\" Philosophers refer to this form \\nof argument as the fallacy of affirming the consequent (where A is the \\nantecedent and B is the consequent). This is an invalid form of argument. \\nIt is instructive to note that many tests of scientific theories take the \\nform, \"If A (this theory is correct), then B (the following results should be \\nobtained).\" For example, a theory of the effects of imagery on memory \\nmight predict that people who form images of information will remem\\xad\\nber more than people who do not form images (see Chapter 6 for a \\ndiscussion of imagery) . Assume that an experiment is conducted, and the \\nprediction holds. Can we conclude that the imagery theory is correct? \\nNote that the form of this argument would be \"If A (the imagery theory \\nis correct), then B (the group told to form images should remember \\nmore); B (the imagery group did remember more), therefore A (the \\nimagery theory is correct).\" As noted above, this is an invalid form of \\nargument because it rests on the fallacy of affirming the consequent. For \\nthis reason logicians caution that one cannot prove a theory correct. \\nInstead, one can only say, \"These results are consistent with the theory\" \\nor \"These results provide support for the theory .\" \\nThere are two more if-then argument forms; one is \"If A, then B; \\nnot A, therefore not B.\" Returning to the trial example, this translates as \\n\"If the murder occurred between 9 and 12 A.M., my client is innocent. \\nThe murder did not occur during this time; therefore, my client is not \\ninnocent .\" This is not an argument you would want to make as a defense \\nlawyer. Fortunately, it also involves what philosophers call the fallacy of \\ndenying the antecedent and is an invalid form of argument. In this case, \\nit is possible that the client was fishing alone at a remote cabin, but no \\none else may have known it; hence, he could not prove that he was not \\nat the scene of the murder when the victim was killed. Nevertheless, the \\nabsence of an alibi does not prove the presence of guilt. \\nThe fourth form of if-then argument is \"If the murder occurred \\nbetween 9 and 12 A.M., my client is innocent. My client is not innocent, \\ntherefore the murder did not occur between 9 and 12 A.

A confirmation bias may cause people to ignore \\nsimple tests that would disconfirm a faulty hypothesis . \\nThe four basic forms of if-then arguments are presented in Table l. \\nSince many people have a difficult time remembering these abstract '),\n",

Start with an antecedent such as \"If it snows six feet tonight\" and \\nadd the consequent \"then public schools will be closed tomorrow.\" As\\xad\\nsume that this relationship will always be true. To determine if any \\nparticular form of argument is valid (B is true; therefore A is true) simply \\nexamine how those arguments would be represented in terms of the \\nfamiliar case. For example, to remember if situation 2 (in Table l) is valid, \\nconsider the following: Schools are closed today (B is true); can we \\ntherefore conclude that it snowed six feet the night before (A is true)? \\nObviously this is not a valid conclusion, since school may be closed for \\nother reasons (such as a holiday, a fire, or summer vacation). If school is \\nnot closed (B is not true), can we conclude that it did not snow six feet \\nthe night before (A is not true)? This is a valid conclusion. Try generating \\nthe other situations in Table l using this model and then try to solve a \\ndifferent set of arguments without referring to the table. For example, \\nconsider the premise \"If it is a triangle, then it is red.\" Now try to answer \\nthe following questions: If the shape is not a triangle, is it not red? If it is \\nnot red, is it not a triangle? (See Appendix A for answers.) \\nThe Consistencq of Arguments \\nAnother important feature of valid arguments is that they are logically \\nconsistent. The search for inconsistencies plays an important role in a \\nmany areas. Consider again a court of law . A witness may provide infor\\xad\\nmation inconsistent with his or her previous testimony or may describe \\nan event in a manner inconsistent with other people\\'s testimony. The \\neffective trial lawyer searches for such inconsistencies and makes sure the \\njury realizes they exist. \\nAn advertisement that appeared in a Tennessee newspaper an\\xad\\nnounced in bold type the following \"A 45-piece tool set for only $10.00 .\" \\nIt went on to describe the pieces included: a hammer, a set of screw\\xad\\ndrivers, a set of Allen wrenches, a retractable metal tape measure. The \\noffer seemed too good to be true. Further, the advertisement described a \\nfree case that could be used to organize the tools and store them neatly. \\nThe advertisement stated that the case allowed you to fold the entire set \\nof 45 tools into just l inch of space. \\nThe information about storing the tools in l inch of space was \\ntotally inconsistent with our previous assumptions about the set of tools; \\nnamely, that it included a full-sized hammer, a set of normal-sized screw\\xad\\ndrivers, and so forth . We reasoned that either the tools must be minus-'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 109}, page_content='Intelligent Criticism Ell \\ncule (like a jeweler\\'s screwdrivers and hammer) or the information about \\nthe 1 inch of storage space must have been a printing error. Our bet is \\nthat the advertisement did not contain a printing error and that the tools \\nare indeed minuscule and worth considerably less than $10.00. Note that \\npeople who failed to see the inconsistency between their assumption \\nabout the tools and the information about storage space were probably \\nangry when they received the product. But the writers of the advertise\\xad\\nment would undoubtedly claim that it told people what to expect and \\ntherefore doesn\\'t qualify as outright fraud. \\nWhen scientists attempt to construct formal theories that explain \\nphenomena, one of the criteria of a successful theory is that · it be inter\\xad\\nnally consistent. In contrast, many of our everyday beliefs have not been \\nsubjected to the rigors of scientific analysis and do not form a system that \\nis internally consistent. \\nConsider everyday beliefs that can be expressed in proverbs such as \\n\"He who hesitates is lost.\" This is undoubtedly good advice, but so is \\n\"Haste makes waste.\" Yet the two contradict each other. Additional ex\\xad\\namples of proverbs that seem contradictory are \\nNothing ventured, nothing gained. \\nBetter safe than sorry. \\nAbsence makes the heart grow fonder. \\nOut of sight, out of mind. \\nMany hands make light work. \\nToo many cooks spoil the broth. \\nIf you attempted to create a formal theory of advice based on \\nproverbs, you would have to deal with this appearance of inconsistency. \\nOne way might be to assume that each of the proverbs provides advice \\nthat is appropriate in some contexts. You would then need to define the \\ncontexts in which they did and did not apply. For example, the proverb \\n\"Many hands make light work\" seems to be appropriate when there is a \\ntask to be done (such as beautifying a yard) that can be divided into \\nrelatively independent components (raking dead leaves, mowing the \\ngrass, trimming around the bushes and fence). In contrast, \"Too many \\ncooks spoil the broth\" is appropriate when several people are given re-'),\n",

As you do so, you will begin to \\nappreciate how looking for inconsistencies and then attempting to \\nresolve them can lead to new insights that previously were taken for \\ngranted, such as the need to define the conditions of applicability of an \\nidea. Harold Kushner 11 provides a fascinating look at one person\\'s at\\xad\\ntempt to create a logically consistent set of beliefs to explain peop le\\'s \\nrelationship to God . \\nThe search for inconsistencies is very important in science. For ex\\xad\\nample, in discussing the search for b lack holes in space, Nigel Ca lder \\ndescribes the work of scientists who studied a galaxy of stars orbiting the \\ngalaxy\\'s center .12 The scientists knew that the speed of rotation of stars \\naround a center or core depends on the mass of the core . The speed of the \\nstars being studied was calculated and found to be extreme ly fast, ap\\xad\\nproximately 250 miles per second. Based on this information it was pos\\xad\\nsible to calculate the mass of the core necessary to sustain such \\nmovement. The calculations revealed that the mass must be enormous, \\nroughly 5000 million times greater than the sun\\'s . \\nCalder notes that the scientists also had access to an e l ectronic light \\ndetector that allowed them to measure the amount of light (brightness) \\ngenerated by the core being studied. He states, \"If there was an enormous \\nnumber of stars at the core, corresponding to the mass, the heart of the \\ngalaxy would be very bright indeed .\" (Note the if-then reasoning used.) \\nWhen the scientists measured the light they found only a relatively faint \\nglow, not a dazzling display; the appearance of the core was therefore not \\nwhat one would expect if it were composed of stars. Calder goes on to \\nobserve that the information about the appearance of the core was inconsistent \\nwith calculations of the mass of the core, unless the core contained a black hole . \\nThe detection of a possible inconsistency was therefore very important; it \\nshowed the need to postulate something-a b lack hole-that would \\nallow the apparent inconsistency between the appearance and the mass \\nof the core to be resolved. \\nI The nnal~sis of He~ Assumptions \\nOur previous discussion emphasized two general classes of strategies for \\ndetecting flaws in arguments: ( l) evaluate the accuracy of factual claims '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 111}, page_content='Intelligent Criticism 11m11 \\nand (2) look for logical flaws and inconsistencies. The third strategy is to \\nevaluate the assumptions on which an argument is based. \\nThe evaluation of assumptions is especially important. For example, \\nthe fact that most arguments are based on sets of assumptions can make \\nit difficult to apply some of the idealized rules of logic discussed earlier. \\nConsider the premise \"If John invents a better mousetrap, he will become \\nrich.\" From our previous discussion we can conclude that it is not valid to \\nargue that John must have invented a better mousetrap because he is \\nnow rich (that is, it is invalid to reason \"If A, then B; B is true, therefore \\nA is true\"). Similarly, we know that it is not valid to say that John will \\nnever become rich because he did not invent a better mousetrap (it is \\ninvalid to reason \"If A, then B; not A, therefore not B\"). However, im\\xad\\nagine that at some time in the future we meet John and find that he has \\nnever become very wealthy. Can we conclude that John never invented \\na better mousetrap? Logically, the form of the argument is \"If A, then B; \\nnot B, therefore not A.\" As discussed earlier, this is a valid form of \\nargument. \\nHowever, the logical forms discussed earlier represent ideal situa\\xad\\ntions. In reality, John may have invented a better mousetrap but never \\nhave marketed it successfully, or people may have stopped buying \\nmousetraps. What appears to be a valid argument logically (If A, then B; \\nnot B, therefore not A) has become an ambiguous situation in the real \\nworld. One reason for this ambiguity is that the truth of the relationship \\nexpressed in our premise (\"If John invents a better mousetrap, then he \\nwill become rich\") depends on the existence of other conditions or assumptions \\n(that mousetraps continue to be purchased, that John employs a good \\nmarketing strategy, or that John finds a financial backer). Generally, \\nwhenever we include events and observations from the real world in our \\nrelationships, , we import additional assumptions or conditions that may \\nnot be obvious immediately. However, these assumptions may have an \\nimportant effect on the reasonableness of the arguments we make. 13 \\nAssumptions and Inconsistencies \\nBasic assumptions must also be analyzed to detect inconsistencies. For \\nexample, anyone familiar with political debates has probably witnessed at \\nleast one in which the politicians present facts or statistics that seem to \\ncontradict one another. How is it possible for such inconsistencies to \\noccur? Although politicians may occasionally make factual errors, more \\noften than not the collection of facts involves subjective judgments or '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 112}, page_content=\"11m1 R Framework for Using Hnowledge More Effectivelq \\nassumptions. For example, two politicians may argue about changes in \\nworkers' income during one of their administrations. The incumbent \\nmay argue that workers' wages increased 30 percent during his admin\\xad\\nistration. The challenger may argue that workers' salaries actually de\\xad\\nclined by 5 percent during the same period . Neither of the statistics cited \\nby the politicians is necessarily wrong ; they may simply be based on \\ndifferent assumptions. Thus, the challenger may have taken into account \\nthe rate of inflation during the survey period and adjusted wages accord\\xad\\ningly, while the incumbent did not. \\nEarlier, we discussed several cases in which an apparent inconsis\\xad\\ntency was resolved by making a different assumption. For example, the \\ninconsistency between a set of 45 full-sized tools and a l-inch storage \\ncase was resolved by assuming that the tools were miniature rather than \\nfull-sized. Similarly, the scientists described by Calder found that the \\nappearance of the galaxy's core was inconsistent with calculations of its \\nmass unle s s they assumed the existence of a black hole. Much scientific \\ntheorizing involves the creation of new concepts and theories that \\nresolve seeming inconsistencies. \\nEveryday comprehension also involves assumptions that resolve in\\xad\\nconsi stencies. Here are some simple statements that appear to contain \\ninconsistencies unless you make the appropriate assumptions. 14 \\nThe floor was dirty because Sally used the mop. \\nJohn is able to come to the party tonight because his car broke down. \\nThe dress wrinkled because Jill ironed it. \\nExamples of assumptions that make sense of these statements appear in \\nAppendix A. \\nNow consider the following problem. \\nA woman called the police and stated that she had just murdered her \\nhusband by shooting him . The police went to the house and found that, \\nsure enough, the man had just been shot. Despite the woman's finger\\xad\\nprints on the gun and her testimony (she also passed a lie detector test), \\nthe courts were unable to punish her by putting her in jail or sentencing \\nher to death. Why? \\nAt first glance, this problem seems to involve an inconsistency be\\xad\\ntween what we know about murder and what we know about the law . \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 113}, page_content='Intelligent Criticism IIBI \\nMost people try to resolve this apparent inconsistency by making as\\xad\\nsumptions, such as \"She really didn\\'t do it,\" \"It was an accident,\" or \"She \\nis insane so she cannot be prosecuted.\" However, in this problem the \\nwoman did commit the crime, she is perfectly sane, and the reason she \\nwas not sent to jail or put to death has nothing to do with legal tech\\xad\\nnicalities (for example, the police failing to read her her rights) . See if you \\ncan come up with an assumption that makes the apparent inconsistency \\ndisappear (the answer appears in Appendix A). \\nThe Reasonableness of Rssumptions \\nThe fact that assumptions play such an important role in evaluating \\nfacts, logical arguments, and apparent inconsistencies has an obvious \\nbut important implication: We must carefully evaluate the reasonable\\xad\\nness of the assumptions that form the basis of arguments. At the begin\\xad\\nning of this chapter, for example, we discussed a murder trial in which \\nthe defense attorney made an analogy between a trial based on cir\\xad\\ncumstantial evidence and a chain . The remainder of his argument to the \\njury was consistent with this analogy. The prosecuting attorney made an \\nalternative analogy, that a trial based on circumstantial evidence is more \\nlike a rope than a chain. This allowed him to counter a number of points \\nthe defense attorney had made; for example, he argued that a few weak \\npoints in the overall testimony were not enough to prove the defen\\xad\\ndant\\'s innocence . \\nMany arguments are based on analogies that, if analyzed, are found \\nto be based on questionable assumptions. Otherwise, such arguments \\nmight seem to make sense, and we would make assumptions and draw \\nconclusions that should probably not be drawn. \\nConsider again the scientist who is asked why he doesn\\'t give up his \\ntheory in the face of criticism. The scientist may respond, \"Your question \\nreminds me of a story about Louis Pasteur. He was ridiculed unmercifully \\nwhen he first suggested his germ theory of disease. As we all know, \\nhowever, he got the last laugh.\" \\nWhat kind of argument is the scientist making by his reference to \\nPasteur? The argument might simply be \"Because a new theory is ridi\\xad\\nculed it is not necessarily invalid.\" On the other hand, the scientist may \\npurposely be using an ambiguous argument to encourage an invited \\ninference, such as \"This situation is just like Pasteur\\'s; therefore, the \\ntheory must be true.\" The scientist\\'s reference to Pasteur illustrates a \\nform of reasoning by analogy that is quite common in everyday situa\\xad\\ntions. To evaluate such arguments, it is important to ask whether a par-'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 114}, page_content='11m H Framework for Using Hnowledge More Effectivelq \\nticular analogy is appropriate, and if so, what its exact implications are \\nsupposed to be . \\nConsider a controversial topic, such as whether couples should have \\nsex before marriage. One response to this question is to say, \"You \\nwouldn\\'t buy a car without taking it out for a test drive, would you?\" \\nAlthough some might agree with this argument, others may be offended \\nby the inappropriateness of the analogy. For example, unlike a car, a \\nspouse does not become one\\'s property, and unlike problems with a car, \\nthose between couples are usually a two-way street. Furthermore, al\\xad\\nthough people usually don\\'t feel guilty after taking a test drive, many feel \\nguilty after premarital sex. \\nYou can undoubtedly find additional problems with the test-drive \\nanalogy, but the basic point is clear: The analogy carries with it a host of \\nassumptions that are inappropriate and misleading . Assumptions have \\npowerful effects on our reasoning and it is therefore important to analyze \\nthose we make as well as those we are invited to make by others . \\nAt the beginning of this chapter, we noted that many ideologies are \\nclosed systems that are difficult to crack because they are based on as\\xad\\nsumptions considered to be immutable . For example, imagine a person \\nwhose beliefs are based on the assumption that you are the enemy and \\nthat one\\'s enemy can never be trusted . Unless you can show that those \\nassumptions are faulty, it is doubtful that any logical argument you make \\nwill be convincing. Thus, in addition to critically evaluating ideas, we also \\nneed to be able to communicate our arguments effectively. In Chapter 5 \\nwe will examine how the IDEAL framework can be applied to problems \\nof communication. \\nI Summar~ \\nIdeologies can play a powerful role in motivating human action. \\nThroughout history, a great deal of suffering has resulted from the un\\xad\\ncritical acceptance of ideologies that have motivated people to harm one \\nanother. It is therefore important for people not to necessarily accept \\neverything they hear or read. They need to be intelligent critics who can \\nidentify possible flaws in their own arguments as well as in arguments \\nmade by others. Subsequently, they can define the goal of their critical \\nanalysis (for example, to evaluate the accuracy of factual claims), explore \\nstrategies for analyzing and correcting an argument, anticipate outcomes \\nand act on the most promising strategies, and look at the effects. If the '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 115}, page_content='Intelligent Criticism liB \\nargument still seems faulty, they can reenter the IDEAL cycle and try \\nagain. \\nThere are three general goals to adopt when evaluating an argu\\xad\\nment. One is the possibility that the argument is based on inaccurate \\nfactual claims. Note that people who make such claims are not necessari\\xad\\nly trying to be misleading or dishonest. Instead, they may simply fail to \\nrealize that their interpretations are in error. \\nA second cause of faulty arguments is the use of inappropriate logic \\nor reasoning strategies. Someone may begin with an acceptable factual \\nclaim (\"Many theories that later turned out to be true were at first \\nridiculed\") but end up with a conclusion that does not follow from the \\nfacts (\"Therefore, since my theory is being criticized, it must be true\"). \\nSimilarly, arguments can contain inconsistencies . For example, an author \\nmay at first state that the views of a historical figure never changed on a \\nparticular issue yet provide an example later on indicating that they did. \\nA third reason for criticism involves the assumptions that form the \\nbasis of an argument. An argument will often seem valid if we grant the \\nunderlying assumption (\"Since war is inevitable, we should make the \\nfirst strike\"). However, once the basic assumption (that war is inevitable) \\nis identified and questioned, an argument will frequently lose its force. \\nThe use of analogies and metaphors also involves assumptions that may \\nor may not be appropriate. Unless these are analyzed, they can lead us \\nastray. \\nI Exercises \\nUse the IDEAL Problem Navigation Guide (in Appendix C) to help you \\nwork through a problem involving critical thinking in the real world. \\nRemember to consider the goals identified in Figure 11. \\n1.

For your ideas to have an important impact, \\nthey must at some point be communicated to others. Without effective \\ncommunication skills, good ideas can easily be ignored. In this chapter we \\nwill examine how the IDEAL framework can be applied to communica\\xad\\ntion problems and opportunities. \\nI The Importance of ldentif~ing Communication Problems \\nThe first step in developing an effective approach to communication is to \\nidentify the existence of potential problems. Although we communicate \\nwith many people every day, most of our communication involves rela\\xad\\ntively routine thinking. We may greet people, conduct transactions at a \\nbank, or discuss recent news events with people at work-activities that \\nare relatively routine. Sometimes these routine attempts to communicate \\nbreak down, and we must identify the problem before serious conse\\xad\\nquences result. For example, most of us have at one time or another \\nmade a comment that was meant to be funny but was misinterpreted by '),\n",

If we do not identify the existence of such a com\\xad\\nmunication problem, we could lose a valued friendship. \\nIn addition to identifying problems that arise in relatively routine \\ncommunications, we must also identify those that arise in nonroutine \\nsituations, such as making a presentation to a large group of people we \\ndon't know . We have seen many attempts to communicate fail when the \\ngoal of communicating with a large group of strangers was approached in \\nthe same way as more routine types of communication such as talking to \\na small group of friends. To develop effective communication skills, we \\nmust first recognize situations that require nonroutine approaches and \\ntreat them as opportunities to develop creative solutions. To help you do \\nthis, we will focus on three ways to think about your communication \\ngoals. \\nI Three Waqs of Defining Communication Goals \\nOnce a communication problem has been identified, it is important to \\ndefine your communication goals . For example, when you are applying \\nfor a job your goal may be to convince the employer that you have \\nsomething important to contribute to the organization . It is important to \\nrecognize that your goal always involves a message (for example, that \\nyou have something important to contribute), an audience (the prospec\\xad\\ntive employer), and a presentation medium (a personal interview, letter, \\nor group presentation) . These subgoals are represented by the acronym \\nMAP-message, audience, presentation medium-and are illustrated in \\nFigure 16. \\nFailure to consider each of these components of your communica\\xad\\ntion goals can frustrate your overall attempt to communicate. For ex\\xad\\nample, if you tried to convince a prospective employer that you are easy \\nto get along with by means of the same communication strategy that you \\nmight use to invite a friend to a party, the prospective employer might \\nmisunderstand the message and think that you are not a diligent worker. \\nThe way you define each of these subgoals can influence the strategies \\nyou use for communication. We will consider in the following discussion \\nhow these subgoals affect the strategies that should be explored for effec\\xad\\ntive communication. Later in the chapter we will consider the impor\\xad\\ntance of anticipating outcomes before ading on your communication \\nstrategies. We will also consider the importance of looking back and learn\\xad\\ning from your attempts to communicate . \"),\n",

For example, imagine that your goal is to win an \\nelection. If the electorate (your audience) includes people with conflict\\xad\\ning sets of beliefs, you may purposely try to be ambiguous. Thus you \\nmight say, \"You know what is needed and I am going to do it,\" in the \\nhope that everyone will make the invited inference that you agree with \\nhis or her ideas. The goal of ambiguity may not be lofty, but it seems to be \\none that people sometimes adopt. \\nWe will assume , however, that your goal is to be clear rather than \\nambiguous. You therefore need to have a clear idea of your message. This \\nmay seem obvious, but it is amazing how often people are unclear about \\nwhat they really want to communicate. They have a general idea of their \\nmessage but when asked to put it into words, they often discover that it\\'s \\nnot so easy to do. \\nConsider the following introduction to a presentation on \\neconomics. 2 '),\n",

Fader\\'s first request was that he state what he \\nmeant by the sentence. The student\\'s response to Fader\\'s question was as \\nfollows: \\nWell, yeah, America \\'s worst economic problems won \\'t be solved until the \\ngovernment , until the government , comes up with some tough new policies . \\nFader asked the student why he had not written this, instead of the \\n\"woes\" and \"plague\" and \"vanquished\" and \"assuage.\" The student\\'s \\nanswer is revealing. \\nThat\\'s just the kind of stuff you use to write about economics and things \\nlike that . \\nIt is possible that some audiences are more impressed by sophisti\\xad\\ncated-sounding words than by the clarity of the message, but this has not \\nbeen our experience . Most people value presentations that provide a \\nclear and concise statement of the key ideas . \\nFader\\'s strategy for helping the economics student better under\\xad\\nstand his message was simple but powerful. He had the student restate \\nthe message in his own words and keep the statement as simple as \\npossible. Fader notes that as the student tried to paraphrase his introduc\\xad\\ntion, he developed a much better understanding of the issues. In the end, \\nhe began his presentation by advising the government to develop tough \\nnew economic policies based on economic facts rather than economic \\npolitics .3 This was a much clearer introduction to the message the student \\nwanted to present. \\nSome people use the strategy of reformulating their message into \\ntwo or three \"talking points\" that summarize the essence of what they \\nwish to communicate. This can be very beneficial in helping you clarify \\nwhat you want to say. \\nI Audience \\nAs you clarify your message it is also important to define your audience. \\nDifferent communication strategies are necessary depending on the '),\n",

Obviously, it would not be wise to speak English to a group of \\npeople who understood only French. Even when people can speak your \\nlanguage, however, you must communicate differently depending on \\nwhat they know . For e x ample, if you wanted to help third and fourth \\ngraders learn something about problem solving, you could probably find \\na way to do so, but it is doubtful that you would suggest that they read \\nthis book. Most children in the third and fourth grades can read, but they \\ndo not have enough knowledge to understand many of the concepts and \\nexamples used in this book. 4 \\nDifferences in Background Hnowledge \\nHere is a message that can be meaningful to the right audience. Try to \\nfigure out how it can be made to make sense. 5 \\nIf the balloons popped, the sound would not be able to carry since every\\xad\\nthing would be too far away from the correct floor. A closed window \\nwould also prevent the sound from carrying, since most buildings tend to \\nbe well insulated. Since the whole operation depends on a steady flow of \\nelectricity, a break in the middle of the wire would also cause problems. \\nOf course the fellow could shout, but the human voice is not loud \\nenough to carry that far . An additional problem is that a string could \\nbreak on the instrument. Then there could be no accompaniment to the \\nmessage. It is clear that the best situation would involve less distance . \\nThen there would be fewer potential problems . With face-to-face con\\xad\\ntact, the least number of things could go wrong. \\nMost people have a difficult time understanding this passage. Given \\nthe information in Figure 17 , however , it makes sense (look at the picture \\nand then read the passage again) . The passage would be quite compre\\xad\\nhensible if you delivered it to an audience that already possessed the \\nrelevant background information . However , the same message would \\nmake no sense to people who did not possess that information. \\nWe often need to discuss a topic even though many members of our \\naudience do not possess extensive background knowledge about it. If you \\nare a lawyer , for example , you may need to communicate information \\nabout biology , psychiatry, or physics to the members of a jury. The use of \\nmetaphors, analogies, and concrete examples can be very helpful in such \\nsituations. Consider Nigel Calder\\'s use of metaphor and analogy to ex\\xad\\nplain about a black hole in space, which he describes as \"a great starswal-'),\n",

To evaluate the appropriateness of analogies and \\nexamples, you must know something about your audience\\'s knowledge \\nbase. \\nFactual information may also need to be presented in different ways \\ndepending on your audience. For example, imagine that you want to \\nmake the following claim: \"By the time they graduate from high school, \\nAmerican children have watched an average of 18,000 hours of \\ntelevision.\" Whether or not your audience will understand the sig\\xad\\nnificance of this depends on how familiar they are with thinking in terms '),\n",

Usually you will need to make such a fact more \\nmeaningful. For example, you might tell your audience that this figure \\namounts to several hours of TV viewing each day, or you could point out \\nthat 18,000 hours is more than most of these students have spent in \\nschool. The units and comparisons that are most meaningful will depend \\non what your audience already knows. \\nOne of the major limitations of school-based instruction in com\\xad\\nmunication is that the presenter\\'s audience is usually very limited, con\\xad\\nsisting of the teacher and fellow students. But in everyday life, one has to \\ncommunicate with people who have different levels of knowledge, ex \\xad\\nperience, and expectations . In these circumstances, it is important to \\nexplore what the audience already knows about your topic and what it \\nexpects from you . \\nTechnical Jargo n Versus Ooublespeak \\nKnowledge of your audience will also help you decide whether to use \\ntechnical language or everyday English. The use of technical jargon can \\ngreatly improve the efficiency of communication. For example, a phrase \\nsuch as \"an A-B, A-C retroactive interference paradigm\" is an extremely \\nefficient way for a scientist to communicate, provided that the intended \\naudience is familiar with this technical term. \\nTechnical jargon can also be used for other purposes. One is to make \\na message less direct and hence less objectionable. For example, Edwin \\nNewman , an authority on the uses and abuses of the English language , \\nnotes that in today\\'s world people are often \"outplaced\" rather than \\n\"fired. \" 7 Similarly , someone who does not own a car is \"transportation \\ndisadvantaged.\" Still another example of jargon designed to make unwel\\xad\\ncome information more palatable is \" strategic retrograde action,\" which \\nwas used to describe retreat during the Vietnam War. \\nWilliam Lutz uses the term doublespeak to refer to technical jargon \\nthat is used to deliberately mislead or deceive people .8 For example, \\nwhen President Reagan proposed a $3 billion tax increase, his advisors \\ndescribed it as a \"revenue enhancement\" so that Reagan would seem to \\nbe honoring his pledge not to raise taxes . When the Reagan administra\\xad\\ntion proposed a plan to increase the federal gasoline tax by 5 cents a \\ngallon, it was disguised as a \"user\\'s fee\" imposed on those who use cars \\nand gasoline. Some forms of doublespeak are even more sinister. For \\nexample, Lutz notes that the investigative reporters Donald Bartlett and '),\n",

Since most of us tend to take our cultural knowledge for \\ngranted, we often fail to realize that others may not share our view of the \\nworld. For example, researchers have presented Americans and natives \\nof India with written descriptions of an American wedding and an Indian \\nwedding. 9 Although members of both groups knew something about \\nweddings, they frequently misinterpreted aspects of the other culture \\'s \\nceremony . The description of the American wedding included the fact \\nthat the bride wore \"something old, something new, something bor\\xad\\nrowed, something blue .\" The Americans knew that this was part of a \\ntradition, but many of the Indians interpreted it differently. They felt \\nsorry for the bride because she had to borrow and wear old clothes. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 130}, page_content='Effective Communication lltDI \\nThe Indians\\' and Americans\\' misinterpretations of each other\\'s \\nweddings were unlikely to have serious international ramifications. Nev\\xad\\nertheless, it is easy to imagine situations in which differences in inter\\xad\\npretation can have unfortunate consequences. For example, the cliche \\n\"When the going gets tough, the tough get going\" is usually interpreted \\nas a statement of the importance of self-determination. Members of \\nanother culture, however, could see it as an attempt to bully by reference \\nto a threat of war. \\nCross-cultural communication is often a problem for companies \\ndoing business in other countries. For example, an article in the Wall \\nStreet Journal described an incident in which a U.S. firm asked its Jap\\xad\\nanese distributor to advertise a new product. 10 The Japanese distributor \\nagreed. A year later the owner of the U.S. firm found that not a single \\nadvertisement had been placed. He later discovered that in Japan \"yes\" \\ndoes not necessarily mean \"Yes, I will do it.\" Instead it often means \"Yes, \\nI understand.\" \\nCommunication often involves nonverbal as well as verbal mes\\xad\\nsages. Like verbal messages, nonverbal messages can be misinterpreted \\nacross cultures. One example of this is eye contact. In the United States, \\nit is generally considered important to \"look people in the eye\"; if you \\nglance into an American\\'s eyes and then quickly look away, you are likely \\nto be perceived as unsure of yourself or even rude. In other cultures, \\nhowever, direct eye contact can have other meanings. In some Native \\nAmerican tribes young children are taught that it is disrespectful to look \\nan elder in the eye, and eye contact by others can seem disrespectful. \\nLikewise, Native American children are often perceived as uninterested \\nby their white teachers because they tend to look away. 11 \\nExpectations of the Audience \\nAn important question to ask about your audience is what its implicit \\nrules of conduct are likely to be. For example, we have attended meetings \\nat which the name of the game was for the speaker to present a lot of \\nhype about his or her ideas and the advantages for the audience in \\nadopting them. There was no serious discussion about the weaknesses as \\nwell as the strengths of the ideas and about how the ideas might be \\nimproved. Imagine that you want to talk about weaknesses as well as \\nstrengths but you are at a meeting where all the other speakers are \\ntrumpeting only the strengths of their ideas. If you come on with a \\nserious discussion of both strengths and weaknesses, you may well seem '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 131}, page_content='111!1 R Framework tor U s ing Hnowledge More Effe c tive!~ \\nboring and weak compared with the other speakers . It is very important \\nto make sure that your goals fit in with the audience\\'s expectations. If \\nyou want to keep your standards high, you will probably find yourself \\nturning down invitations to speak in some settings where the expecta\\xad\\ntions do not match your own. \\nSeveral years ago one of us went to an academic symposium that \\nwas attended by more than 500 people and featured four nationally \\nknown speakers. Each speaker spoke for about 20 minutes, followed by \\nquestions and comments . The room became tense as the fourth speaker \\npresented data that called into question a theory that the first speaker \\nhad published several years earlier. After the fourth speaker finished, the \\nmoderator asked the first speaker if he wanted to reply. You could have \\nheard a pin drop as the first speaker approached the podium . He began, \\n\" About my paper where I argued that. . .. \" Then he paused and, with a \\ngrin, said, \"Can I take that back?\" The room broke into applause . \\nThis first speaker \\'s courage taught us a powerful lesson . Science is \\nbased on respect for data rather than for slick performances. The speaker \\ndemonstrated his respect for the data, and the audience greatly appre\\xad\\nciated his acknowledgment . But not all audiences are like this. \\nI Presentation Medium \\nThe third component of MAP is the presentation medium you use when \\npresenting your message . Possible formats include oral presentations , \\nwritten presentations, interactive software , and interactive multimedia. \\nEach of these is discussed below. \\nSome Hdvantages of Speaking \\nGiven a choice between a friendly face-to-face conversation and writing \\na letter or paper, most people prefer the conversation . One reason is that \\nmost people speak much faster than they write. The slowness of writing \\nis one of the major reasons that people do not like it. They think that its \\nslowness interferes with their thinking, which can seem quite fast . \\nAnother advantage of speaking over writing is that speakers can \\nconvey more in different ways. They can use facial expressions, gestures, \\nand different intonations to make their messages clear. In addition, \\nspeakers usually have a number of chances to clarify their meaning, since \\nthe audience can ask questions or indicate it does not understand. In '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 132}, page_content='Effective Communication ltDI \\ncontrast, writers are usually isolated from their audience, and they are \\nunable to rely on outside sources of information such as gestures. Writers \\nmust therefore work hard to state their ideas clearly and avoid ambiguity. \\nMany people do not like this extra work. \\nSome Advantages of Writing \\nAlthough writing does need to be less ambiguous than spoken language \\nand is slower, it has its advantages. An extremely important one is that \\nwriting persists over time and space and so can be analyzed with consid\\xad\\nerably more care than can spoken language. Indeed, some theorists argue \\nthat the invention of written language was one of the hallmarks of \\nhuman development because it enabled people to become more precise \\nin their analysis of arguments. \\nOne way to appreciate the greater precision of written language is to \\ncompare written and spoken sentences. If you tape-record everyday \\nconversations and then type them word for word, you will be amazed at \\nthe number of false starts, pauses, \"urn\\'s,\" and other imperfections. The \\nlinguist Wallace Chafe provides the following illustrations. 12 \\nI\\'m feeling OK now (laugh), but uh I had last week I thought I was \\n(laugh) dying . You heard that I fainted in the shower. \\nWhen we are listening to others we tend not to notice all the false starts \\nand pauses. When we write, however, we are expected to produce sen\\xad\\ntences that are well organized. We therefore need to plan and evaluate \\nour statements more carefully. \\nThat written language persists over time and space also has advan\\xad\\ntages that go beyond the level of individual sentences. Since written \\ninformation can be stored, it is easier to compare earlier statements with \\nthose made later on. This can lead to the detection of inconsistencies and \\nenable the writer to rethink his or her ideas. \\nAn additional advantage of writing over speaking is that it does not \\nrequire that we begin at the beginning and proceed until we reach the \\nend. Papers can be written in any order we choose. Interestingly, many stu\\xad\\ndents do not realize this at first and may spend hours trying to find \"the \\nperfect\" introductory sentence or paragraph. Experienced writers often \\nskip the introduction or spend very little time on it at first because they \\nknow that they will get a better idea of their thesis as they write and will \\nend up redoing the introduction anyway. Experienced writers can also \\nwork on different parts of a paper at different times. For example, if at '),\n",

Writing permlts a great deal of fle x ibility in the strategies you use. 13 \\nEffective Use of Visual Rids \\nVisual aids can greatly facilitate communication regardless of whether \\nyou intend to communicate orally or in writing. For example, one of us \\nrecently participated in a committee that was set up to explore salary \\ninequities across disciplines at the university. One of the administrators \\ninterviewed by the committee was certain that there were inequities \\nacross disciplines and said that although he had tried for years to con\\xad\\nvince the faculty of the problem, he had never been successful. The \\ncommittee realized that it needed a simp le way to illustrate the salary \\ninequities so that even people who did not feel comfortable with num\\xad\\nbers could understand . A visual representation similar to the one the \\ncommittee used is shown in Figure 18 . The committee\\'s report generated \\nsuch a strong reaction from the faculty that action was soon taken to \\ncorrect the problem. \\nV> ... \\n.!2 \\n0 \\n\"0 \\n.5 \\n>-... \\n\"\\' <0 \\nVl \\nR gure 18 \\n55 , 000 \\n50,000 \\n45 , 000 \\n40 , 000 \\n35 , 000 \\n30 , 000 \\nLocal Nati o nal \\nDi s ciplin e A \\nL o cal Nati o nal \\nDi s ciplin e B '),\n",

The effectiveness of an illustration ultimately \\ndepends on whether it helps clarify the underlying message and whether \\nit can be seen and understood by the audience. We have seen numerous \\npresentations in which tables or charts were used that presented too \\nmuch information too quickly. In other cases, presenters fail to enlarge \\nthe information sufficiently for the audience to see important details. \\nEdward Tufte 14 has described many of the problems that can detract from \\nthe effectiveness of visual illustrations. \\nInteractive Computer Programs \\nModern computer technology makes it possible to create new forms of \\ncommunication that combine some of the advantages of spoken and \\nwritten messages. Programs that interact with users (that is, with your \\naudience) are one example. Imagine that you want to write a letter to \\nyour mother, but you want to program it on a computer and store it on \\ndisk rather than write it down on paper. You might write the program so \\nthat when your mother uses the disk with her computer, the message on \\nher screen reads: \"Hi, Mom. I have several things to tell you. Please \\nchoose the topic you want to start with.\" \\nYour computer program might then provide a menu of topics, such \\nas (l) \"How I spent my summer vacation,\" (2) \"When I could come to \\nvisit,\" and ( 3) \"Why I want to get married next month.\" By selecting l, 2, \\nor 3, your mother could read about each topic in the order she chooses. \\nIn addition, you could program tests that increased the probability that \\nyour intended message was conveyed. For example, after your mother \\nhad read part of your message, you could provide choices allowing her to \\nindicate her reaction. Thus you might ask, \"What do you think about \\nwhat I\\'ve just told you?\" Choices might be (1) \"\\'\\'m elated,\" (2) \"It\\'s okay, \\nbut certainly not great,\" or (3) \"You are disinherited.\" Your program \\ncould then respond in different ways depending on your mother\\'s answer \\n(that is, on how she interacted with your program). If she chose option 3 \\n(\"You are disinherited\"), for example, your program could respond with \\n\"Wait a minute, you must have misunderstood something,\" and so forth. \\nInteractive computer programs have the potential to provide interactive \\ncommunication in which answers depend on questions. In addition, the \\nmessage can persist in space and time. '),\n",

These can all be controlled at the touch of a computer \\nbutton and so can be used in extremely powerful ways. In a presentation, \\nvideo, sound, and other resources can be used to illustrate one's points. \\nEach medium has different strengths . For example, we find that some \\npoints simply cannot be made forcefully by talking about them, but their \\nsignificance immediately becomes apparent in a short videoclip. In other \\ncases, people prefer written documents over videos because they want to \\nanalyze the information in detail. \\nMultimedia technology is already changing the standards people \\nhave for effective presentations. In many circles it is no longer sufficient \\nsimply to talk to the audience and use overheads that list the main points. \\nInstead, audiences want to see and hear what the speakers are talking \\nabout. The good side of these changes is that people are learning to use \\nthe new resources to communicate in powerful new ways. The bad side \\nis that multimedia can make it easier for glitz to win out over substance. \\nUltimately, however, audiences will demand substance from multimedia \\npresentations . \\nI Evaluating the Effectiveness of Your Attempts \\nto Communicate \\nAnticipate Outcomes and Ret \\nOften it is difficult for the person who delivers the message to anticipate \\nthe consequence of using a particular communication strategy .

For example, if you know the size \\nof the room where a presentation will be given, it is easy to determine \\nwhether the audience will be able to see your visual aids clearly. How\\xad\\never, anticipating how the audience's expectations and attitudes will in\\xad\\nteract with your communication strategies is more difficult to assess and \\nmay require that you obtain outside input. Similarly, editors and publish\\xad\\ners often solicit comments from individuals whose opinions may be rep\\xad\\nresentative of the intended audience for a new article or publication. \\nLook and Learn \\nOnce you have acted on your communication strategy it is important to \\nlook at the effects to learn from your experience . This is especially impor\\xad\\ntant if your goal is to become an effective communicator, since people are \\nrarely outstanding at this the first time they try. \\nAudience feedback can be an important source of information about \\nthe effectiveness of your strategies and the appropriateness of your goals. \\nFor example, the questions people ask can help you evaluate whether \\nyou defined the nature of your audience correctly and used communica\\xad\\ntion strategies that allowed people to relate your message to their own \\nexperiences. \\nVideotaping your presentation can also provide an effective way of \\nlooking back at your presentation (at mannerisms, intonation, gestures, \\nanswers to questions) and can help you improve your effectiveness. We \\nhave observed many instances of a speaker's communication goals being \\ndisrupted by an annoying presentation style or an inability to answer \\nquestions without becoming defensive. Critically reviewing a videotape \\nof your own presentation can help you identify potential problems and \\nbetter define your goals for improvement. \\nThe IDEAL framework and the MAP configuration shown in Figure \\n16 provide a useful framework for looking at the effects of your attempts \\nto communicate and learning from them. For each component of MAP , \\nask yourself if you failed to identify potential problems, clearly define \\nyour goals, explore a wide enough range of strategies, or anticipate the \\neffects of various strategies . If your experiences are like ours, you will \\nfind that there is something useful to learn from every attempt to com\\xad\\nmunicate. \"),\n",

These subgoals are message, audience, \\nand presentation, or MAP: define the message you plan to present, define \\nthe audience to which you will present it, and define the presentation \\nformat (oral, written, interactive, multimedia) that you plan to use . Each \\nof these subgoals affects the selection of an effective communication \\nstrategy . \\nIn considering your message, explore strategies for clarifying what \\nyou really want to say. Although this may seem obvious, it is an impor\\xad\\ntant step that is often overlooked . \\nIt is also important to carefully define the audience. A message that \\nis perfectly comprehensible to one audience may be a complete mystery \\nto another. When we attempt to communicate across cultures we run \\ninto additional problems, since what is understood may be very different \\nfrom what we intended. \\nAlso, consider the audience's expectations of a presentation. Does it \\nexpect glitz , hype, and cheerleading or a serious analysis of issues? Fail\\xad\\nure to address this question can lead to serious mismatches between \\naudience and presentation. \\nWhen choosing a presentation format, explore the advantages and \\ndisadvantages of different media, including oral communication, writing, \\nvisual illustrations, interactive software, and multimedia. \\nFinally, it is important to evaluate attempts to communicate and \\nlearn from them. The IDEAL approach, together with the MAP subgoals, \\nprovides a useful framework \\nfor evaluating effects . \\nI Exercises \\nUse the IDEAL Problem Navigation Guide in Appendix C to help you \\nwork though a real-world communication problem.

We also noted that many problems require specialized \\nknowledge-knowledge that we must first learn and remember. In Part 2 \\nwe consider ways of improving our ability to acquire new knowledge. \\nThe goal of this chapter is to explore strategies that can increase our \\nability to remember information. These strategies operate like other use\\xad\\nful tools that human beings have developed. Like a good hammer, for \\nexample, a memory tool can help us perform tasks that otherwise would \\nbe difficult or even impossible. However, just as a hammer may be ap\\xad\\npropriate for some tasks but not for others (pounding nails versus tight\\xad\\nening a bolt, for example), a particular memory strategy may or may not \\nbe appropriate, depending on the nature of the problem. The exploration \\nand eventual selection of strategies must therefore be preceded by iden\\xad\\ntification of the particular memory problem to be solved and by a careful \\ndefinition of one's goals. The appropriateness of particular strategies can \\nthen be evaluated by anticipating the outcome of using them, acting on \\nthose that seem most promising, and looking back at their effects to see if \\nthey have helped to accomplish the defined goals. These are all com\\xad\\nponents of the IDEAL model discussed in Chapter 2. This model will \\nprovide the basis for our discussion of improving memory performance. \\nWe begin with an analysis of a simple memory task. \"),\n",

His son read the directions and then asked to \\nborrow a pen. The reason, the son explained, was to write the combina\\xad\\ntion of the lock inside his tennis shoes and gym bag. \\nThis is an excellent illustration of everyday problem solving that \\ninvolves the need to remember information. First and foremost, the son \\nidentified the existence of a potential problem. If he locked his locker but \\ndid not know the combination to the lock, he would be unable to get to \\nhis clothes. Locks often have to be cut off of lockers because people fail to \\nrecognize the existence of this potential problem. \\nThe son also defined his goals for solving the problem, at least im\\xad\\nplicitly. He asked himself, \"How can I make sure I know this combination \\nwithout having to memorize and risk forgetting it? After exploring pos\\xad\\nsible strategies he decided to write the combination inside his tennis \\nshoes and gym bag. The son explained that he had first thought about \\nwriting the combination inside his street shoes but then changed his \\nmind. Implicitly, at least, he anticipated the effect of this potential strategy \\nand realized that it would not work . Although he would be wearing \\nstreet shoes to the gym, his street shoes would be locked in his locker \\nduring gym class. \\nThe boy\\'s father pointed out a different strategy for remembering \\nthe combination-an elaboration strategy. He noted that the first num\\xad\\nber, 13, was his son\\'s age; the second number, 8, was the month of his \\nson\\'s mother\\'s birthday; and the third number, 14, was the age his son \\nwould be on his next birthday. At first the son was skeptical of this \\nstrategy but later found that it worked well. \\nThe combination lock problem is one of thousands that revolve \\naround the task of remembering information. The father and son each \\nused strategies that, while different, were both effective in helping them \\naccomplish their goals. \\nExamples of Different Strategies \\nTo understand how different memory goals require different types of \\nstrategies, consider the following problem. The list below contains 2 5 \\nwords; spend approximately 1 1!2 minutes studying the list (approximate\\xad\\nly 4 seconds per word). Then, without looking at the list, write down as \\nmany of the words as you can. Please begin now. '),\n",

We will \\ndiscuss these differences from the perspective of the IDEAL framework. \\nWe assume that all people identify the existence of a problem since \\nthey have been told that there is a problem to be solved. Most people \\ndefine the goal as recalling as many words as possible in any order. They \\ntherefore explore strategies such as organizing related words and recalling \\nthem in categories. For example, couch, desk, chair, and bed; trumpet, \\npiano harp, and drum; and so forth. \\nCategorization strategies can be very useful for remembering. How\\xad\\never, as with all memory strategies, their usefulness is strongly dependent \\non the memory goal. Imagine that the preceding task had been to recall \\nthe words in their exact order of appearance. Now a categorization \\nstrategy would no longer be optimal. A better strategy would be to con\\xad\\nstruct a story that uses each word in the order in which it appears (for \\nexample a couch potato wearing a hat played a trumpet while sailing in \\nhis boat. Then he went home to his desk and ... ) . \\nAs an additional example, assume that the goal is to recall all the \\nwords in reverse order, and to do this quickly. The categorization strategy \\nis not appropriate, and the story strategy also leads to problems because \\nit is difficult to tell a story from end to beginning. However, the peg-word \\nstrategy that will be discussed later in this chapter is excellent for achiev\\xad\\ning this goal. \\nHere are some additional memory goals that could be adopted for \\nthe list of 2 5 words. \\n1. Remember the words that contain at least one e . \\n2. Remember the two-syllable words. \\n3. Remember the words that occur third, fifth, tenth, and \\ntwentieth on the list. \\n4. Remember the words that are homonyms (those that have \\nat least two distinct meanings, such as traffic jam and \\nstrawberry jam). \\n5 . Remember the words in alphabetical order. \\nEach of these goals requires the use of different strategies for learning. \\nEffective problem solvers must be flexible; they must define their goals '),\n",

For example, it is especially impor\\xad\\ntant to know whether it will be an essay exam or a multiple-choice exam. \\nFor an essay exam, you need to explore strategies that will help you \\norganize and remember information without strong retrieval cues; you \\nmight therefore generate acronyms (discussed later) and use other proce\\xad\\ndures for helping you retrieve relevant information. For multiple-choice \\nexams, retrieval is less important because each choice is in effect a poten\\xad\\ntial retrieval cue. For multiple-choice exams, it is usually better to pay \\nattention to definitions and make sure that you have learned the distinc \\xad\\ntions among terms that you need to know . \\nWe discuss various strategies in more detail later. For the moment, \\nit is important to note that people's approaches to the preceding memory \\nproblem also differ with respect to the anticipate/act and look/learn com \\xad\\nponents of the IDEAL process. For example, some people begin by an\\xad\\nticipating the effects of different strategies, acting on one they think will \\nwork, and looking at the effects. If one strategy does not work, they may \\nchange strategies as they proceed through the list. In contrast, other \\npeople use the same strategy throughout the entire task. Differences in \\nthe anticipate/act and look/learn components become even more ap\\xad\\nparent if the task is changed. For example, imagine that the problem is to \\nstudy until you are confident of your ability to recall all the words on the \\nlist. Effective learners will undoubtedly change their strategy if the initial \\none seems ineffective and concentrate their attention on words they \\ncannot recall rather than on those that they can recall. \\nThe Effectiveness of Different Strategies \\nIf you experiment with memory problems like the one just presented, \\nyou will undoubtedly find that some of the strategies are more effective \\nthan others . For example, the simple strategy of repeating each word \\nsevera l times will usually result in poorer recall than such strategies as \\norganizing words into categories or making up a story (and perhaps \\nsupplementing it with images) that links all of the words .2 Later we \\ndiscuss why some strategies are better than others. \\nAs we said earlier, the appropriateness of a strategy depends on the \\nnature of the memory problem you are trying to solve . Suppose you look \\nup a new phone number and want to remember it only long enough to \\nwalk across the room to dial. You are therefore attempting to solve a \"),\n",

An effective strat\\xad\\negy in this case is simply to repeat the number to yourself as you walk \\nacross the room. Interestingly, even this simple strategy involves a rela\\xad\\ntively sophisticated level of problem solving. Studies with kindergarten \\nchildren show that, although they may want to remember information, \\nmany children do not realize that they need to repeat it. 3 Not surprising\\xad\\nly, those who did not repeat the information also did not remember it \\nwell. \\nReturning to the earlier problem, 25 is far too many words to hold \\nin short-term memory by simple repetition (generally, we can hold only \\nfive to nine units of information in short-term memory). 4 The problem \\nrequires that we store the words in long-term memory for which such \\nstrategies as simple repetition are not as effective as those involving \\ncategorization or the construction of stories and images. Similarly, the \\nlatter strategies are effective only for certain types of memory problems. \\nThe remainder of our discussion of memory is organized into three \\nsections . The first concerns the processes of human memory, an under\\xad\\nstanding of which can help you remember more effectively. We will \\nshow , for example, the although attention is a prerequisite for remem\\xad\\nbering, it does not guarantee it. The second section explores ·some strat\\xad\\negies for remembering that have been devised over the centuries . By \\nusing these strategies, people often find that they can solve memory \\nproblems they had assumed were too difficult for them. In the final \\nsection we discuss the importance of adapting memory strategies to your \\nown situation and inventing new ones when necessary. \\nI Understanding Basic Memor~ Processes \\nResearchers in cognitive psychology have discovered some basic prin\\xad\\nciples of human memory that are very useful in helping people learn to \\nsolve memory problems. We explore three of them: attention, elabora\\xad\\ntion, and retrieval. \\nRttention \\nImagine that you are a student and need to learn a great deal of informa\\xad\\ntion in a short time . You missed several classes, so a friend has tape\\xad\\nrecorded lectures from a history class and an economics class . Since you \\nare so pressed for time, you design a system that allows you to play the \\nhistory lecture into your left ear and the economics lecture into your '),\n",

Will this method allow you to learn twice as \\nmuch in the same amount of time? \\nIf you have ever attempted to study when people are interrupting \\nyou, you probably answered no to this question . It is very difficult to \\nattend carefully to more than one source of information at a time , espe\\xad\\ncially if both messages contain information that is unfamiliar. 5 \\nAttending to the Right Information \\nEven when we hear or read only a single message, we can easily miss \\nsome of the information. Read the following passage once: \\nMany foods cost too much. Food costs would diminish if farm land was \\nnot so costly. In addition, tractors and additional tools cost way too \\nmuch. Politicians should also diminish any tax on farm products. A high \\ntax on such products hurts us all. \\nNow try to remember as much about this passage as you can without \\nlooking back. If you studied the passage, the chances are quite good that \\nyou can easily recall its main points. However, without looking back at \\nthe passage, suppose you have l 0 seconds to answer a different question: \\n\"How many words in the passage contain the letter e?\" You might be able \\nto estimate the number of e\\'s by recalling the words and checking each \\none, but this will take a considerable amount of time and you will prob\\xad\\nably make mistakes. Although most passages of this length include a \\nconsiderable number of e\\'s, this one does not . (You may have noted that \\nthe wording was a little strange; that\\'s because it only used words that do \\nnot contain an e). \\nYou would have been able to answer the question about the num\\xad\\nber of e\\'s in the passage much more easily if you had known about it \\nbeforehand. You would then have know to focus your attention on this \\nproblem as you read. Had you done so, however, chances are you would \\nhave missed something about the meaning of the passage. Even in a \\npassage this simple, there is more to attend to than we can process in a \\nsingle trial. It is important to define your memory goals ahead of time so \\nyou can attend to the relevant information. 6 \\nElaboration Processes \\nThe preceding discussion illustrates the importance of attending to infor\\xad\\nmation that is relevant to your memory goal. Researchers have also '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 148}, page_content='Improving Memorij Skills liB \\nfound that memory is affected by our ability to relate new information to \\nprevious experience and knowledge. This is known as \" elaboration.\" An \\nexample of how elaboration can facilitate remembering was presented at \\nthe beginning of this chapter; it involved of a father\\'s and son \\'s strategies \\nfor remembering the combination to a lock. The father elaborated on the \\ninformation by making it meaningful. To remember the number 13 , he \\nelaborated by relating it to the current age of his son . \\nIn many situations people elaborate information without thinking \\nabout it. For example, consider the following sentence . \\nJohn was late for work because of the snow. \\nMost people will automatically elaborate this sentence by relating it to \\nexperiences they have had traveling to or from work or school during a \\nsnowstorm. Routine elaborations such as these make it easier to under \\xad\\nstand and remember information, but they also depend on our ability to \\nrelate new information to our own past experiences. \\nFrequently, however, elaboration requires more conscious effort. \\nespecially when the relationship between the new information and pre\\xad\\nvious experience is not obvious. College students often tell us about \\nclassmates who can sit through a lecture without taking notes and re\\xad\\nmember almost everything. In contrast, they can remember very little , \\nand they worry that their memory is poor. We try to help these students \\nunderstand that remembering information is comparatively effortless or \\ndifficult depending on what one already knows about a topic . If you \\nknow a lot about a topic, it is much easier to elaborate the information \\nand remember what you hear or read . \\nPlease try the following experiment. Spend no more than 4 seconds \\nreading each of the sentences listed below, and read each one only once . \\nMost important, try not to use any elaboration strategies such as generating \\nimages or thinking of people you know. \\nJohn walked on the roof . \\nBill picked up the egg. \\nPete hid the axe. \\nJim flew the kite. \\nFrank flipped the switch.

It requires a familiar sequence of visual \\nimages that can be recalled easily and used as retrieval cues. One such \\nsequence would be scenes you know from a familiar route, such as one '),\n",

Basically , you need \\nto ( 1) form an image of each object to be remembered, and (2) place it in \\nyour imagined scene. Thus , if the first object is \"horse,\" you might im \\xad\\nagine it jumping through the front door of your house. If the second \\nobject is \"rocket,\" you might imagine a huge rocket in the second location \\nyou come to in the living room (such as the couch) . Ideally, the visual \\nscene you use should have as many locations as there are objects to \\nremember, and you should proceed through your scene in a natural \\norder that is easy to remember . In addition, it can be helpful to form \\nimages that have vivid and unique interactions. \\nBelow is a list of 10 words for you to attempt to remember by using \\nthe method of loci. Spend enough time on each word to form an image \\nof it and of its place in a scene that is vivid and unique. \\ncarrot trumpet \\nmoose pillow \\nhelicopter scissors \\nIndian goat \\nchicken cherry \\nWithout looking back at the list, try to recall the words in the order in \\nwhich they occurred by using the retrieval cues in your familiar path. \\nNow try to recall them in reverse order. This can be done easily by \\nreversing the direction in which you move through your imaginary \\nscene. \\nFor another memory problem, recall as quickly as possible the fifth \\nword from the preceding list, then the third, then the seventh, and so \\nforth . Although it is possible to use the method of loci to achieve this goal, \\nit would be very cumbersome and time-consuming to walk through all \\nthe scenes while counting them . A much better strategy for solving this \\ntype of memory problem is to use images indexed to a numerical code. \\nThe peg-word system is one such strategy .

First you \\nneed to examine a person's features and try to identify those that most \\ndistinguish his or her face from other faces. For example, identify the \\nunique features of the face in J;'igure 19 and make up a word or phrase \\nthat helps you remember the unique features . Use the letters in the word \\nor use the first letter of each word in the phrase to remind you of a facial \\nfeature.

For example, to remember the notes of the G \\nclef, it is helpful to use the phrase \"Every good boy does fine .\" Such \\nphrases are called acrostics. Both acrostics and acronyms can be effective \\ntools because they substitute easily remembered words or phrases for \\nmore complex and unrelated concepts; in short, they substitute an easier \\nmemory task for a more difficult one. These strategies work as long as the \\nletters function effectively as retrieval cues. However, they may not be \\nvery effective for remembering unfamiliar words or concepts. For ex\\xad\\nample, most people would not find the word \"bunt\" to be a good \\nacronym for the names Baum, Ulpa, Nidia, and Treim, because the names \\nthemselves are so unfamiliar. Similarly, an acrostic would be ineffective if \\nit were too complex to be remembered. \\nI Adapting and Inventing Memor~ Strategies \\nSo far in this chapter we have focused on analyzing basic memory proces\\xad\\nses and giving examples of powerful memory strategies. This will provide \\nthe foundation for improving your ability to invent your own ways to \\nsolve memory problems . Invention is important because a particular \\nstrategy may or may not be optimal depending on how much you already \\nknow about what is to be remembered and your specific goals. The more \\ninventive you can be, the better your memory will become. \\nBecause the effectiveness of memory strategies varies as a function \\nof goals and personal knowledge and experience, it is important to learn \\nto invent strategies that suit your purposes. Thus, depending on the \\nsituation , you might invent acronyms and acrostics or special rhymes and \\nrules . Assume, for example, that you want to remember whether the \\nhead of a school is a principle or a principal. You could create a memory \\naid , such as \"The head of the school should be a pal.\" \\nExamples of Memor~ Problems \\nListed below are some common memory problems . Try to invent techni\\xad\\nques for solving them.

In general, snakes that have adjacent red and black stripes have \\nno poison whereas those that have adjacent red and yellow stripes do. \\nDevise a memory scheme that will help people remember which type of \\nsnake is which. \\nIn boating, the term \"port\" is used for left and \"starboard\" for right. \\nDevise a way to remember these facts . \\nThe combination of a new lock is I I-S- 14. Devise a memory strategy \\nthat will help you remember it. \\nIn each of the problems presented above, the amount of informa\\xad\\ntion that needs to be remembered is rather small. What is difficult about \\neach one is that it is easy to confuse one thing with another (for example, \\nto confuse \"port\" with right rather than left). The ability to reduce this \\nkind of confusion is an important criterion for any memory technique\\'s \\neffectiveness. \\nStrategies for External Storage \\nA powerful strategy for enhancing memory is to store information exter\\xad\\nnally (on paper) rather than to attempt to remember it directly. This may \\nseem obvious, but even here there is considerable room for invention. \\nDifferent ways of organizing information affect the ease of performing a \\ntask. \\nImagine that you write a grocery list containing 15 items, such as \\nmilk, cereal, apples, and dog food. Once you get to the grocery store there \\nare several ways you might use this list. One is to get the first item on \\nyour list, then the second, and so forth. However, if the items are not \\norganized according to the sections in your grocery store, you will be \\nforced to make a number of trips back and forth throughout the store. \\nAnother way to use the grocery list is to walk to one section of the \\nstore (the dairy section, for example) and scan your list for all items that \\nmay be found there. Next, walk to another section of the store (pet foods) \\nand scan your list again. This is more efficient than walking back and \\nforth across the store, but unless your list is organized in a way that fits \\nthe organization of your grocery store, it is still not optimal. \\nStoring information in a way that enables us to obtain easy access to \\nrelevant information is especially important when the amount of infor-'),\n",

The infor\\xad\\nmation it contains is organized in a way that makes it relatively easy to \\nfind a phone number or street address if you know the person\\'s name. It \\nalso makes it easy to determine the number of people in that city who \\nhave the same last name. However, imagine that you want to know the \\nphone numbers of all the people who live on 21st Avenue or in the \\neastern part of the city. You would have to search through every entry in \\nthe phone book to find this information. Needless to say, this would be a \\ntedious procedure. \\nIn many situations externally stored information (a data base) needs \\nto be searched from a variety of perspectives. If you run a business, for \\nexample, you may want to call or send announcements to everyone who \\nlives in the area where it is located. Or you may want to send mailings \\nonly to those whose income is over a certain amount, or only to those \\nwho have visited your store during the past year. Similarly, if you are \\ntaking notes on articles and books, you may sometimes want to refer only \\nto those by certain authors or about particular topics. As the example of \\nthe phone book indicates, it can be very difficult to store information in \\nways that permit easy access to such categories. \\nFortunately, modern computer technology is making it possible to \\ngain access to data bases using a variety of search categories. For example, \\ncomputerized data bases in libraries can allow you to search for articles \\non the basis of information about the author, title, date of publication, \\nsubjects covered, and key words used in the article. A computerized data \\nbase of cookbook recipes might allow you to search for recipes on the \\nbasis of title, important ingredients, country of origin, or nutritional \\nvalue. Computers therefore provide a powerful means of enhancing \\nmemory. Even with computers, however, you must choose the format for \\nrepresenting and retrieving information that is most appropriate to your \\nneeds. Since the computer\\'s ability to search for information depends on \\nhow data bases are organized and how you query them, your ingenuity \\nwill have important effects on what the computer can do. \\nI Summar~ \\nIn this chapter, our discussion emphasized the relationship between \\nremembering and problem solving. People who are good at remembering \\ninformation develop effective problem-solving skills. First, they are able \\nto identify situations that may cause memory difficulties (\"This is too \\nmuch information to hold in short-term memory\" or \"If I am not careful '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 165}, page_content='1111 H Model tor Requiring New Hnowledge \\nI will get confused and forget whether port means right or left\") . Second , \\nthey define their goals appropriately (\"I want to remember whether star \\xad\\nboard refers to the right or left\") . Third, they explore a variety of strategies \\nand select those that are appropriate to their goals . Fourth , they an \\xad\\nticipate the effects of different strategies and act on those that are most \\npromising. Fifth, they look at the effects of particular strategies on perfor\\xad\\nmance (that is, on their ability to remember) and consider how to ap\\xad\\nproach future memory problems. If their performance has been poor, \\nthey reenter the IDEAL cycle and may redefine their goals or select or \\ninvent different strategies . They then act on these new strategies and look \\nat the effects, continuing to improve their memory skills . \\nIt is important to understand the relationship between strategy se \\xad\\nlection and how we define our memory goals. First, particular strategies \\n(simple repetition or categorization, for example) are appropriate for \\nsome goals but not for others. Second , it can be useful to examine some \\nof the basic research on memory. For instance, researchers find that it is \\ndifficult to attend to multiple sources of information, and even with only \\none source we must still decide what aspects of that information are \\nimportant. Elaboration also plays an important role in remembering in\\xad\\nformation. While elaboration may be relatively effortless in some situa\\xad\\ntions, it can require a great deal of effort in others . Another research \\nfinding is that storage of information does not guarantee its retrieval, and \\nthe selection and evaluation of strategies must take into account the \\nnature of the retrieval environment . If no retrieval cues are going to be \\nprovided, for example, you need to generate a retrieval scheme of your \\nown. In addition, the probability that particular retrieval cues will be \\neffective can be increased (by forming interactive images, for example). \\nFinally, the improvement of memory skills is an ongoing process. A major \\nchallenge is to become skilled at inventing new memory techniques for \\nsolving problems that you may confront in everyday life. \\nI Exercises \\n1.

The \\neffective use of memory strategies will enable you to remember impor\\xad\\ntant information, such as a person\\'s name, when you are confronted with \\na particular retrieval cue, such as that person\\'s face. However, suppose \\nyour goal in learning is not simply to remember information but to \\nunderstand it so that you can apply it in creative ways to the solution of \\nproblems that arise in the future. There are important differences be\\xad\\ntween remembering information and understanding how to use it to \\nsolve novel problems. \\nAs an illustration of the difference between remembering and un\\xad\\nderstanding, consider a friend of ours who discovered that he had an \\nallergy to milk products and was given a pill by his doctor to help him \\ndigest milk. The doctor told him to take the pill 30 minutes before eating \\na meal. The statement \"Take the pill 30 minutes before eating\" was easy \\nfor our friend to remember. However, one day he encountered an unan\\xad\\nticipated problem: He had just finished a meal that included milk \\nproducts and suddenly realized that he had forgotten to take his pill. His \\ngoal was to decide what to do. Would it do him any good to take the pill \\nnow, or should he cancel his next appointment in anticipation of a reac\\xad\\ntion to the milk? Might it actually be harmful to take the pill after eating? \\nOur friend could not answer these questions for himself, because he had '),\n",

He had remembered a proce\\xad\\ndure (to take the pill 30 minutes before eating), but he did not under\\xad\\nstand enough about how the pill worked to solve his problems. Without \\nunderstanding, it can be difficult to solve unanticipated problems. \\nOur friend\\'s dilemma illustrates important differences between un\\xad\\nderstanding a situation and simply memorizing information about it. \\nStrategies that improve memory without helping us to understand can \\ncreate what Alfred North Whitehead 2 called \"inert knowledge.\" He used \\nthe term to refer to information that a person is able to recall when \\nexplicitly asked to do so, but that he or she is not able to apply spon\\xad\\ntaneously to the solution of problems. A goal of this chapter is to show \\nthat comprehending new information-learning with understanding-is \\ndifferent from merely memorizing that information. The strategies neces\\xad\\nsary to solve comprehension problems differ from those necessary for memoriza\\xad\\ntion. We begin by showing how comprehension involves problem solving \\nand how the goal of understanding differs from the goal of simply \\nremembering. \\nI Comprehension as Problem Solving \\nTo illustrate how comprehension involves problem solving, read the pas\\xad\\nsage below. 3 \\nSally let loose a team of gophers. The plan backfired when a dog chased \\nthem away. She then threw a party but the guests failed to bring their \\nmotorcycles. Furthermore, her stereo system was not loud enough. Sally \\nspent the next day looking for a \"Peeping Tom\" but was unable to find \\none in the yellow pages. Obscene phone calls gave her some hope until \\nthe number was changed. It was the installation of blinking neon lights \\nacross the street that finally did the trick. Sally framed the ad from the \\nclassified section and now has it hanging on her wall. \\nMost people have difficulty comprehending this passage. They under\\xad\\nstand each word and each sentence alone, but something seems to be \\nmissing. They cannot find an explanation for why Sally is doing what she \\nis doing and how one sentence in the story leads into the next one. \\nAfter identifying the existence of a comprehension problem, some \\nreaders may feel that the passage is gibberish and define their goal as not '),\n",

Other readers may approach the prob\\xad\\nlem differently . For instance, they may conjecture that the passage pre\\xad\\nsupposes some information not available to them that might be available \\nto someone more familiar with Sally. Consequently, they may define their \\ngoal as trying to find the presupposed information. These readers may \\nthen explore various strategies for solution . For example, they may think \\nof possible reasons for Sally's activities (maybe she's in love with some\\xad\\nbody), anticipate possible outcomes, and act on the strategy that seems \\nmost likely to help them understand the passage . Then they can look at \\nthe effects . If their initial hypothesis doesn't work , they can generate and \\ntest alternative hypothe s es . They may move through the IDEAL cycle a \\nnumber of times. \\nNow imagine that you are going to be tested on the Sally passage . \\nMany students might assume that their goal is simply to remember the \\ninformation in the passage, and they will explore strategies appropriate to \\nthat goal. You could undoubtedly memorize all the sentences by using \\none of the strategies discussed in the previous chapter (for example, \\ninteractive imagery). But consider what would happen if you were asked \\nthe following questions : \\nI . Where did Sally put the gophers? \\n2. Why did Sally want the guests to bring motorcycles? \\n3. Whose number was changed? \\n4. Who probably made the calls? \\n5. What did the advertisement say? \\nIf you failed to understand the passage about Sally and simply memorized \\nit, you would find it very difficult to answer such questions. \\nThe passage becomes much more comprehensible when you can \\nformulate an explanation for Sally's actions. Assume, therefore, that \\nSally is trying to get a neighbor to move. Given this information , read the \\npassage again and try to answer the questions posed above. \\nThe Sally passage illustrates two points. First, comprehension invol\\xad\\nves a problem- solving process . Second, understanding often requires \\nmore than the simple memorizing of information (see Figure 22). The \\nability to remember all the sentences in the Sally passage does not guar\\xad\\nantee your ability to do other things with the information, such as make \\nintelligent inferences. When we learn with understanding, we are able to \\napply information to a broader range of tasks than when information is \\nsimply memorized. \"),\n",

This seems to be the case in all instances of com\\xad\\nprehension; people are often surprised to learn how much they make use \\nof previously acquired knowledge in order to comprehend. Consider the \\nfollowing passage. 4 \\nA thirsty ant went to a river . He became carried away by the rush of the \\nstream and was about to drown . A dove was sitting in a tree overhanging \\nthe water . The dove plucked a leaf and let it fall . The leaf fell into the \\nstream close to the ant and the ant climbed onto it . The ant floated safely to \\nthe bank. Shortly afterward, a birdcatcher came and laid a trap in the \\ntre e . The ant saw his plan and stung him on the foot. In pain the \\nbirdcatcher threw down his trap. The noise made the bird fly away . '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 175}, page_content=\"Learning With Understanding BfJ1 \\nA number of assumptions are necessary to understand this story. \\nFor example, readers usually assume that the ant walked to the river and \\nthe dove flew to the tree, although this information was never explicitly \\nstated. Similarly, readers understand that the ant could drown because it \\nrequires oxygen (in contrast, you would not worry about a fish drowning \\nin a river), that the dove probably plucked the leaf with its beak, and so \\nforth . Basic information about doves and ants therefore plays an impor\\xad\\ntant role in the inferences that readers make. \\nOther inferences must also be made to understand this story . One \\ninvolves the characters' goals . For example, most people assume that the \\ndove plucked the leaf to save the ant, that the birdcatcher's plan was to \\n·trap the dove, and that the ant bit the birdcatcher to repay the dove for \\nits previous favor. Note that none of this information is stated in the \\nstory; all of it is generated by the reader . Indeed, the story does not even \\nstate that the ant and the dove saw each other. The author of the passage \\ndid not need to state this information explicitly; it was assumed that \\nreaders would supply it . Communication would be cumbersome if speak\\xad\\ners and writers had to provide all the information necessary for compre\\xad\\nhension. If we lack the relevant background knowledge, however, we \\nmay be unable to make the assumptions necessary to understand what \\nspeakers and writers wish to communicate. 5 \\nPrerequisites to Understanding \\nIn the previous discussion we noted that many of the inferences required \\nfor comprehension draw on relevant background knowledge. In some \\nsituations this background knowledge may involve many complex and \\ninterconnected concepts. Consider the following summary of a talk at a \\nscientific meeting. \\nPete argued that data gathered from a NASA spaceship's voyage to Venus \\ncalls into question current theories about the formation of our solar sys\\xad\\ntem. Part of his talk emphasized the importance of mass spectrometers. \\nHe then discussed the isotopes of argon 36 and argon 38 and noted that \\nthey were of higher density than expected. He also cited the high values \\nof neon found in the atmosphere. He has a paper that is already written, \\nbut he is aware of the need for further investigation as well. \\nMost people who are asked to read this passage could do little more \\nthan memorize it.

In the next section we explore some of the \\nprocesses involved in learning about a new domain. \\nI ~earning about New Areas of Hnowledge \\nOne of tl}.e best ways to understand the process of learning is to consider \\nhow expertise is acquired in various fields such as mathematics, physics, \\nbiology, and psychology. For example, assume that you know only a little \\nabout biology and that your goal is to learn more. Assume that the \\ncurrent lesson involves veins and arteries. You might read in a textbook \\nthat arteries are thick and elastic and that they carry blood rich in oxygen \\nfrom the heart, blood that is pumped in spurts; veins are thinner and less \\nelastic and carry blood rich in carbon dioxide back to the heart. For a \\nnovice, even this relatively simple set of facts can seem arbitrary and \\nconfusing . Was it veins or arteries that are thin? Was the thin one or the \\nthick one elastic? Which one carries carbon dioxide from the heart (or \\nwas it to the heart)? \\nThe problem of arbitrariness can be illustrated in simple sentences \\nthat are comprehensible to nearly everyone. Spend no more than a few \\nseconds reading each of the following statements about a group of \\npeople. 6 \\nThe fat one bought the padlock. \\nThe strong one cleaned the paintbrush. \\nThe cheerful one read the newspaper. \\nThe skinny one purchased the scissors. \\nThe funny one admired the ring. \"),\n",

The major reason for this difficulty is that the \\nrelationship between the person and the action performed seems ar\\xad\\nbitrary; there is no clear reason that a particular person should perform \\nthat particular activity. Novices in the field of biology feel similarly about \\nthe propertie s of veins and arteries; relationships between these entities \\nand their properties seem arbitrary. For example, why should arteries \\nrather than veins be elastic or nonelastic, thick or thin? \\nMemor~ Strategies \\nThere are several ways to approach the problem of mastering information \\nthat seems arbitrary at first. One is simply to repeat the facts until they are \\nmemorized (artery thick elastic; artery thick elastic). A more efficient \\napproach is to use memory techniques similar to those discussed in Chap\\xad\\nter 6.7 The use of imagery is one technique. That arteries are thick could '),\n",

That arteries are elastic could be remembered by imagining \\nthat the tube is suspended by a rubber band that stretches and contracts, \\ncausing the tube to move up and down. You could embellish the image \\nby having red liquid (blood) and round (like an o) bubbles (oxygen) \\npouring out of the tube, and these could be moving away from an image \\nof a Valentine \\'s Day heart. This composite image could help you to re\\xad\\nmember that arteries are thick and elastic and carry blood rich in oxygen \\naway from the heart . Another technique would be to use verbal elabora\\xad\\ntions; for example, \"Art(ery) was thick around the midd le so he wore \\npants with an elastic waistband.\" \\nComprehension Strategies \\nWe noted earlier that the ability to remember information is no guaran\\xad\\ntee that you will be able to make inferences and use it to solve new \\nproblems . Suppose you learn that arteries are elastic by imagining either \\na rubber band holding a tube or thick-waisted Art and his elastic waist\\xad\\nband. What if you were confronted with the problem of designing an \\nartificial artery? Would it have to be elastic? What would be the potential \\nimplications of hardening of the arteries? Would this have a serious \\nimpact on people\\'s health? Having used the imaging techniques to re\\xad\\nmember that arteries are elastic, you would have little basis for answering \\nthese questions. \\nMemory techniques are useful for many purposes, but a very differ\\xad\\nent approach is needed to develop an understanding of veins and arteries. \\nEffective learners attend to facts, but they also try to understand their \\nsignificance. For example, the passage stated that arteries are elastic. What \\nis the significance of elasticity? How does this property relate to the func\\xad\\ntions that arteries perform? An effective learner might seek out informa\\xad\\ntion to clarify this relationship. The passage also stated that arteries carry \\nblood from the heart, blood that is pumped in spurts. This provides one \\nclue about the significance of elasticity-arteries may need to expand and \\ncontract to accommodate the pumping of blood. An effective learner \\nmight ask why veins do not need to be elastic. Perhaps because veins carry \\nblood back to the heart, they have less need to accommodate the large \\nchanges in pressure resulting from the heart\\'s pumping of blood in spurts. \\nSome learners could carry this process a step further, asking why \\nblood does not flow back to the heart through the arteries. Since there \\nare arteries in the neck and shoulder regions, arterial blood must flow up \\nas well as down. The answer to this question might provide an additional '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 179}, page_content=\"Learning With Understanding \\nclue about the significance of elasticity-the expansion and contraction \\nof arteries might help blood move in a particular direction. Elasticity \\nmight therefore serve as a one-way valve that enables blood to flow \\nforward but not back. An artificial artery might therefore be equipped \\nwith valves instead of being nonelastic. However, this solution might \\nwork only if the spurts of blood did not cause too much pressure on the \\nartificial artery. \\nThe passage does not provide information about pressure require\\xad\\nments, so a learner would have to look elsewhere for this information. \\nNote, however, that he or she could identify the need to obtain this \\nadditional information. The effective learner's methods are not unlike \\nthose employed by good detectives or researchers confronting a new \\nproblem. Initial assumptions may ultimately be found to be incorrect, but \\nthe act of seeking clarification is fundamental to the development of \\nexpertise. In contrast, the person who simply concentrates on techniques \\nfor memorizing facts will never know whether there is something more \\nto be understood. \\nRrbitraru Sentences Reconsidered \\nThe importance of searching for information that can clarify the sig\\xad\\nnificance of facts and relationships can also be illustrated by the set of \\nsentences about the people and their activities that was presented earlier. \\nWe noted earlier that memory strategies can help us retain important \\ninformation. However, these techniques do not help us understand why \\neach person performs a particular activity. \\nAn alternative approach to the problem is to figure out how each \\nperson might be suited to a particular activity. This is analogous to asking \\nwhy certain entities (such as veins or arteries) have the particular struc\\xad\\ntures and functions they do. The following list of sentences is identical to \\nthe earlier list, except that each contains an elaboration that should help \\nyou explain why it might be appropriate for each person to perform the \\nactivity that he or she does. Read the sentences through once, and then \\nattempt to answer the questions that follow. \\nThe fat one bought the padlock to place on the refrigerator door. \\nThe strong one cleaned the paintbrush used to paint the barbells . \\nThe cheerful one read the newspaper announcing that he had won the \\nlottery. \\nThe skinny one purchased the scissors to use when taking in her pants. \\nThe funny one admired the ring that squirted water . \"),\n",

We created a passage about two imaginary \\nrobots and asked two different groups of fifth-grade students to study \\nthem until they felt that they had learned the information . Both groups \\nof students could decode words adequately; however, one group was \\nmore successful academically than the other . \\nHere is one of the passages that we presented to the children . Im \\xad\\nagine that your goal is to understand why each robot has the particular \\nfeatures that it does. Pay attention to the learning strategies you use to \\nachieve this goal. \\nBill's father worked for a company that made robots. His company made \\nrobots for a business that washed outside windows . They needed two \\nkinds of robots . One kind of robot was needed to wash windows in two\\xad\\nstory houses. These windows were small. The other kind of robot was \\nneeded to wash the outside of windows of high-rise office buildings. \\nThese windows were big. \\nBilly went to visit his father at work. He saw the new robots that his \\nfather had made. The robot used for houses was called an extendible \\nrobot. It could extend itself so it would be almost as tall as a two-story \\nhouse. Billy saw that this robot had spikes instead of feet . It had legs that \\ndid not bend. Its stomach could extend in length to make it taller. The \\narms on the robot were short. Instead of hands, it had a small sponges. In \\nits head was a nozzle attached to a hose . Billy also saw that the exten\\xad\\ndible robot was made of heavy steel. It had an electric cord that could be \\nplugged in. The robot also had a ladder on its back. \\nBilly then saw another robot called a nonextendible robot. This robot \\nhad suction cups instead of feet. It had legs that could bend . Its stomach \\nwas padded. The arms \\non the robot were long. Instead of hands, it had \\nlarge sponges. In its head was a bucket. Billy also saw that the nonexten\\xad\\ndible robot was made of light aluminum. There was a battery inside the \\nrobot. The robot also had a parachute on its back. \\nDid you find yourself attempting to understand why each robot has \\nits particular features? For example, did you try to explain why the \\nwindow-climbing robot might have a battery and the extendible robot an \\nelectrical cord? If so, you approached this passage in a manner similar to \\nthat of the academically successful students who participated in our \"),\n",

Here is one fifth grader's explanation for why each robot had \\nparticular properties: \\nYou would know that the robot that had to go up on tall buildings to \\nwash the windows would need to be lighter and not use an extension cord \\nbecause it would be too long and might make it fall. It had a parachute \\nin case it did fall. It also had large sponges because the windows were big. \\nYou 'd also know that the robot used to wash two-story houses was more \\nheavy and had an extension cord 'cause there are plugs. It would rise up \\nwith its stomach and could spray with the hose that came through its \\nhead . You can't have a hose if you climb real high . \\nMichelene Chi and her colleagues 9 have also found that successful \\nstudents are more likely to explore explanations during the learning \\nprocess than are less academically successful students. They examined \\nthe learning strategies that college students used as they encountered \\nproblems in their physics texts. Chi and her colleagues found that suc\\xad\\ncessful students engaged in a process of explanation; they tried to figure \\nout why each aspect of the solution was applicable, and they asked \\nthemselves about other problems to which the solution might also be \\napplicable. As a result, they acquired an understanding that was more \\ngeneral than a mere memorization of the specific steps involved in a \\nparticular problem would afford. \\nFurther Illustrations of Memor~ Versus Comprehension Strategies \\nIt is useful to consider other examples of strategies for memorizing facts \\nand relationships versus strategies for understanding the significance of \\nthose facts and relationships. Consider first the pairs of scissors shown in \\nFigure 23. 10 Imagine that you study them until you can draw each pair \\nof scissors from memory. This will provide no guarantee that you under\\xad\\nstand how the physical features of each pair of scissors are related to its \\nfunction. Table 2 lists the primary function of each pair of scissors. Given \\nthis information, the particular structure of each pair becomes more \\nmeaningful. Clearly, the relationship between each pair's structure and \\nfunction are not arbitrary; for example, the structure of the dressmaker's \\nshears allows fabric to be cut on a flat surface. The ability to understand \\nthe significance of relationships such as these has a number of potential \\nbenefits. One is that people who understand them are in a better position \\nto invent a new pair of scissors that would allow them to perform par\\xad\\nticular tasks more efficiently.

Another prob\\xad\\nlem is that people write down cues that are too vague.

We emphasized that learning with understanding requires a set of \\nstrategies different from and often more complex than those required by \\nmere memorization. As we explore various comprehension strategies it is \\nimportant to anticipate their effects. \\nMany researchers have emphasized how important it is to monitor \\nthe effectiveness of learning strategies. Ann Brown 14 and John Flavell 15 \\nwere pioneers in the study of what has come to be called metacognition\\xad\\nthe ability to monitor and regulate one's own learning. \\nMonitoring the outcome of our attempts to learn depends, to a great \\nextent, on our ability to anticipate situations in which we will need to use \\nthe new information. Whether a mountain-climbing trip, a speech, or a \\ntest in school is involved, it is important to imagine how you will ul\\xad\\ntimately use the knowledge to decide if you have learned enough to \\nhandle the challenges that you will confront. The clearer your idea of \\nwhat you will need to know, the better your ability to assess whether you \\nare prepared . Some examples are provided below. \\nLevels of Understanding \\nAnticipating the effects of learning strategies by imagining future uses for \\nthe knowledge gained is especially important because there are many \\nlevels at which concepts and phenomena can be understood . Knowledge \\ncan be mastered at different levels of precision, and the precision neces\\xad\\nsary depends on the uses to which the knowledge will be put. \\nAs an illustration of different levels of precision, assume that a \\ngroup of people read a passage about veins and arteries, such as the one \\ndescribed earlier. Some may feel that they have learned enough when \\nthey understand that veins and arteries are parts of the body as opposed \\nto, say, parts of a car engine. Others may not feel they have learned \\nenough until they understand that veins and arteries carry blood rather \\nthan serve some other bodily function. Still others may study until they \\nunderstand how veins and arteries are similar and different in structure \\nand function. For example, they may feel it is important to know that \\narteries are more elastic than veins and to understand why. \\nDifferences in the precision of one's knowledge may or may not be \\nimportant for subsequent performance. Assume, for example, that you \\nare asked the following multiple-choice question. \"),\n",

Both b and c \\nThis question requires a considerable amount of information about art\\xad\\neries. However, one may answer such a question correctly yet still fail to \\nunderstand why arteries are elastic. As a result, additional questions \\nmight not be answered correctly. \\nFor another illustration of levels of precision, think of how nearly all \\nadults know the concept \" gold,\" as in gold watch or valuable metal. 16 \\nThis understanding is precise enough for many purposes. For example, \\nmost of us can distinguish a gold ring from a silver ring, and we know \\nwhat is being referred to when people talk about the price of gold.

Such tests provide the \\nopportunity to actively apply one \\'s knowledge and , ideally, reveal any \\nconfusions, uncertainties, or gaps in one\\'s understanding. They serve a \\nfunction similar to the simulations and tests used by NASA to uncover \\npossible problems that might be encountered by astronauts on space \\nmissions. \\nThe importance of discovering gaps in our understanding can be \\nillustrated by reading the paragraph below . \\nThis is a two-player game . Each player is given a deck of cards numbered \\n0 through 9 . The cards are placed face down in front of each player. Each \\nplayer turns over the top card of his or her deck. If the sum of the two \\ncards that are face up equals I 0, they are removed from the table. If they \\ndo not equal I 0 the player takes back the card, places it back in the deck, \\nand shuffles it. The winner is the one with no cards left . \\nWe have presented this description to many students with instruc \\xad\\ntions to either memorize the description or evaluate its usefulness in \\nteaching addition to young children.

If you still have not found the inconsistencies in the rules, \\ntry working through an actual game mentally, or try using real cards \\n(answers appear in Appendix A). \\nThis example illustrates that monitoring the effectiveness of a learn\\xad\\ning strategy can involve the active application of ideas to specific situa\\xad\\ntions. If we know we are able to use a set of rules to play a game, solve a \\nmathematical problem, or produce a concrete model, then we have ac\\xad\\nquired a better understanding of our own understanding. In the game \\ndescription provided above, instructions that make the game impossible \\nto win or end were deliberately inserted. In other learning tasks such \\ninconsistencies are a clear signal either that our level of understanding \\nis not adequate or that there is something deficient in the material we \\nare trying to understand. In either case, the detection of inconsistencies \\nserves as a signal to identify a new problem in our understanding and to \\nreenter the IDEAL cycle. \\nIn his autobiography, Charles Darwin describes a conversation with \\nSedgwick, a geology professor, that dramatically illustrates the impor\\xad\\ntance of detecting inconsistencies. Darwin was in his early 20s at the \\ntime. One evening Darwin told Sedgwick about a laborer he had met \\nwho had discovered a large tropical shell in an old gravel pit in the \\nmidland counties. Sedgwick immediately responded, \"It must have been \\nthrown away by someone into the pit,\" adding, \"If really embedded there \\nit would be the greatest misfortune to geology, as it would overthrow all \\nthat we know about the superficial deposits of the Midland Counties .\" \\nSedgwick\\'s remark had a profound effect on Darwin because it sensitized \\nhim to the relationship between theory and data. Because of his theoreti\\xad\\ncal knowledge, Sedgwick was very sensitive to potential inconsistencies \\nbetween theory and data and hence was able to identify potential prob\\xad\\nlems of interpretation that Darwin had not noticed at all. 18 \\nAnticipating Problem s of Recess \\nUnderstanding how people process information can also help you to \\nbetter anticipate the adequacy of your current level of learning . In Chap\\xad\\nter 6 we noted that there are important differences between storing \\ninformation and retrieving (accessing) it later on.

People often fail to solve problems not because they lack the rel\\xad\\nevant knowledge but because they are unable to gain access to it. \\nHere is a problem we have given to a number of college students \\nenrolled in our courses on learning and memory. \\nProfessor X claims that students who have difficulty in school do so be\\xad\\ncause they have a much higher forgetting rate than do more successful \\nstudents . He \\nsupports his claim with the following study. A group of \\nacademically successful and less successful fifth graders read a story \\nduring school on Monday . The next day they are all asked to recall as \\nmuch of the story as they can. On average, the successful students recall \\n80 percent of the story correctly; the corresponding score for the less \\nsuccessful students is 65 percent. Professor X argues that these data \\nsupport his claims about forgetting rates. Can you find problems with his \\nargument? \\nMany students come up with weak answers to this problem . Some say, \\n\"He studied only fifth graders; maybe it\\'s not true for kids in other \\ngrades .\" Others state, \"You can\\'t prove much by only a single study.\" \\nAlthough these statements have some validity, they miss the crucial flaw \\nin Professor X\\'s reasoning . He claims to have studied forgetting, yet he \\nhasn\\'t shown that the less successful students learned as much initially . \\nPerhaps a lack of attention or of previously acquired knowledge pre\\xad\\nvented the less successful students from learning as much of the story in \\nthe first place. Without some knowledge of how much was learned (ob\\xad\\ntained, for example, by giving the children a test right after they hear the \\nstory), one cannot make claims about the rate at which forgetting oc\\xad\\ncurred. \\nAs we have noted, many college students fail to find the crucial flaw \\nin Professor X\\'s argument. The interesting point is that this failure is not \\nnecessarily caused by a lack of knowledge. We gave students this problem \\nafter they had studied forgetting; lectures had emphasized that forgetting \\npresupposes that something has been learned in the first place (you \\ncannot forget something you haven \\'t learned) . The students\\' failure \\ntherefore stemmed from a failure to access relevant information. \\nAdditional evidence for this is provided by the second part of our \\nexperiment. Approximately 5 minutes after the students had first at\\xad\\ntempted to solve the problem, we gave it to them a second time. This time \\nwe said, \"Remember our earlier discussion of the relationship between \\nforgetting and previous learning.\" Given this hint, the majority of the '),\n",

Ideally, however, \\nthey should not have had to rely on such hints. \\nHere is a third example of overreliance on hints or clues. 19 A grad\\xad\\nuate student we know was studying for a test in statistics. The previous \\ntest had covered a number of chapters on probability theory; the instruc\\xad\\ntor had provided study sheets for each chapter. The graduate student \\nfound that he could easily solve each of the problem sets provided by the \\ncourse instructor, so he was convinced he was ready for the test. At this \\npoint one of us took out a pair of scissors, cut out the test questions from \\neach problem sheet, and mixed them up. The graduate student could no \\nlonger solve the problems. He had unconsciously been using his know\\xad\\nledge of the chapter each problem came from to decide which formula to \\napply. When this information was no longer available, he discovered a \\nproblem with the way he had learned the material. He therefore changed \\nhis study strategy, paying much more attention to questions about when \\nand why particular formulas should be used . 20 \\nI ~ooking at the E ffects and ~eaning to ~earn \\nNo matter how carefully you try to anticipate the context in which infor\\xad\\nmation will be needed, you will not always be completely successful. As \\na result, you will find yourself unprepared for some emergency or unable \\nto answer a question. This can have negative consequences, such as a \\nlower grade in a course or embarrassment at a meeting. The most impor\\xad\\ntant thing to do in such situations is to try to identify the reason for your \\nerror and to establish a goal that will prevent the same mistake from \\nhappening again. People who program computers use the word debugging \\nfor figuring out why a program they have written won't run (they have \\nto get the bugs out) . It is important to develop debugging strategies for all \\nour activities . \\nMany people adopt strategies that make debugging difficult, if not \\nimpossible . After receiving a relatively poor score on a test, for example, \\nmany students avoid looking at the test in any detail: They try to forget \\nabout an unpleasant experience. Although it is natural to want to avoid \\nunpleasant situations, this is a surefire way to keep from learning from \\none's mistakes . \\nIf you have difficulty with a topic despite having studied, several \\ndebugging strategies can help you define the nature of your problem \\nmore precisely. First, look at the types of questions you were able to \"),\n",

Did the ones you missed require a \\nmore precise level of understanding than you had acquired? You should \\nalso try to discover where the information necessary to answer the ques\\xad\\ntions you missed is located . Was it in the text? In your notes? If it was , \\nyou must have overlooked it, perhaps because you failed to realize that it \\ncould be important for solving certain problems. If the relevant informa\\xad\\ntion was neither in your notes nor in the book , chances are that you need \\nto work on effective note-taking skills. \\nProfessors and other experts can provide feedback helpful in debug\\xad\\nging your learning strategies . To use these sources effectively , however , \\nyou must first attempt to communicate what you have mastered. It is \\nonly then that the expert can evaluate your understanding of the subject \\nand make suggestions that can be used to modify your learning strategies. \\nImagine you meet someone who is an expert in a topic with which \\nyou are having difficulty. You could begin by explaining that you have \\nbeen having trouble determining whether you have learned enough. \\nExplain further that you have studied several topics that seem important \\nand that you would like help in determining whether your knowledge is \\nadequate. You can then ask the expert to question you about problems \\nthat beginners should be able to solve. This will allow you to discover \\nquite quickly whether you are missing information that is crucial. If you \\ndo this for a number of topics, you will also develop an understanding of \\nthe expert's criteria for adequate understanding. \\nThis approach to debugging takes commitment and preparation, \\nand you must be brave enough to risk making mistakes in front of others . \\nNevertheless, it is an efficient and valuable way to learn. Furthermore, \\nwe are confident that most instructors and experts will respect your \\nmotivation and maturity. They know that it is harder to understand than \\nto memorize, and they respect genuine attempts to understand. \\nI The IDER~ C~cle and ~ifelong ~earning \\nThe previous discussion emphasized the importance of looking back at \\nour approach to learning so that we can identify potential problems in \\nour learning strategies. Indeed, identifying problems in our approach to \\nlearning can create opportunities for improvement that can be applied \\nthroughout life . We can take advantage of these opportunities by re\\xad\\nentering the IDEAL cycle with the general goal of improving the effec\\xad\\ntiveness of how we learn. We might discover that we have not defined \\nour learning goals clearly or that we have selected a level of under-\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 195}, page_content=\"~earning With Under s tanding -\\nstanding that was inappropriate for the task we had to perform. These \\nobservations will help us recognize the need to pay more attention to our \\ngoals and to how well we anticipate future uses of our knowledge . \\nReentering the IDEAL cycle and attempting to debug our ap\\xad\\nproaches to learning creates opportunities for what many researchers \\nrefer to as learning to learn. Lauren Resnick 2 1 emphasizes that everyone \\nin society must learn to learn and solve a range of problems-not just a \\nselect few. One \\nreason we need lifelong learning skills is that job require\\xad\\nments tend to change rapidly. For instance, consider the field of auto \\nmechanics. It used to be that the knowledge and skills necessary for \\nsuccess in this area were relatively stable. But today's auto mechanics \\nneed to keep up with rapidly changing technologies, such as advances in \\ncomputerized electronic controls . Indeed , the skills required for most \\nprofessions will change rapidly as new technologies are integrated into \\nthe workplace. Those who are able to learn new concepts and procedures \\nwill have a better chance of maintaining their jobs or advancing their \\ncareers . \\nI Summar~ \\nIn this chapter we applied the IDEAL framework to the problem of learn\\xad\\ning with understanding . The goal of learning with understanding re\\xad\\nquires different strategies than simple memorization of information. It is \\ntherefore important to carefully define your goals (learning with under\\xad\\nstanding versus simply memorizing) once a learning problem or oppor\\xad\\ntunity has been identified . \\nNovices who learn about a new area of knowledge frequently con\\xad\\nfront the problem of how to master facts and relationships that seem \\narbitrary . For example, there appears to be no reason that an artery \\nshould be elastic or nonelastic, thick or thin . One approach to the prob\\xad\\nlem of learning arbitrary relationships is to use such memory techniques \\nas interactive images. An alternative strategy is to explore why things are \\nthe way they are-to search for relationships between the structure and \\nfunction of veins and arteries, between the features of robots and their \\nintended function , between the shape and materials used in Native \\nAmerican houses and the environment, and between the shape of scis\\xad\\nsors and their function . \\nStrategies for learning with understanding are often more complex \\nand difficult than those that help us to merely memorize information. \\nNev~rtheless, the e x tra effort is usually worthwhile because concepts that \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 196}, page_content='liB R Hodel for Requiring New Hnowledge \\nare understood can function as conceptual tools that allow us to solve \\nsubsequent problems. Thus, the person who understands why veins and \\narteries are constructed as they are is in a much better position to ap\\xad\\nproach the problem of designing an artificial artery. The mere memoriza\\xad\\ntion of facts rarely results in useful conceptual tools . \\nIt is also important to antidpate the outcome of using a particular \\nlearning strategy so that we can act on the most effective strategy. One \\nreason for anticipating the challenges that will confront us is that any \\xad\\nthing can be learned at different levels of precision. For example, our \\nunderstanding of such concepts as airports, gold, or veins and arteries can \\nvary in precision, and the level of precision necessary will depend on the \\ngoals we have for using that knowledge . Thus, a child may have only a \\nvague knowledge of airports and yet be able to use this knowledge to \\nunderstand the statement , \"Aunt Jane is coming so we need to go to the \\nairport.\" However, a child who is going to travel alone on commercial \\nairlines may need a more precise understanding of ticketing, baggage \\xad\\nchecking procedures, and airport security regulations . \\nThere are several ways to improve our ability to anticipate the ef\\xad\\nfects of our learning strategies. One is to devise self-tests and simulations. \\nAnother is to be sure that our knowledge can be retrieved with limited \\nexternal cues . \\nIt is often impossible to accurately anticipate all the problems (test \\nquestions, questions following a talk, and so forth) that we will ulti\\xad\\nmately face. As a result, we will sometimes be unable to answer ques\\xad\\ntions, and we will make mistakes. Effective learners try to look back at \\ntheir attempts to learn and learn from their mistakes; they develop strat \\xad\\negies that enable them to avoid making similar mistakes in the future . \\nThe development of these debugging skills is an important aspect of \\nlearning to learn . \\nI Exercises \\nUse the IDEAL Problem Navigation Guide in Appendix C to work \\nthrough a nonroutine learning problem that is important to you .

How o ld is th e ca p ta in l \\nApproximately three-quarters of the children in Reusser\\'s study at\\xad\\ntempted to supply a numerical answer to this problem. Their approach \\nwas to add, multiply, or divide rather than check to see if the problem \\nmade sense. \\nOur reaction to Reusser\\'s data was that this must have been a \\nspecial group of students who had been taught poorly. We gave the \\nproblem to one of our own children who was in fifth grade. Much to our \\nsurprise and dismay, the answer given was 36. When we asked why, we \\nwere told, \"Well, you need to add or subtract or multiply in prob lems like \\nthis, and this one seemed to work best if I add.\" Procedures such as \\naddition and multiplication are often applied in very rote ways. \\nFindings like these are just one of many reasons that people have \\nbegun to seriously question the effectiveness of our educational system. \\nThe major concern is that schools are not doing enough to he lp people \\nbecome proficient at so lving problems and learning on their own. These \\nconcerns are justified on the basis of experimental studies li ke the one \\njust described, poor scores of American students in science and math \\ncompared to those of students in other countries, and the complaints of \\nbusiness leaders that most graduates cannot learn effectively and think \\nfor themselves. \\nIn a world that is changing at an increasingly rapid pace, peop le \\nmust be ab le to adapt to new situations that require creative and non\\xad\\nroutine thinking.

Second, we dis\\xad\\ncuss some new approaches to instruction that organize learning around \\nthe goal of solving authentic, meaningful problems. These approaches \\ndiffer from traditional methods that first present the facts and principles \\nand then present applications problems at the end of each lesson. Third, \\nwe consider assessment and its relationship to the IDEAL framework . \\nThe ability to look at the effects of our actions and learn from them is \\ncritical. If we want to improve our ability to think rather than memorize, \\nwe must be able to evaluate our thinking. Most assessments, however, \\ntest memory for specific facts and procedures . One of the major challen\\xad\\nges in redefining instruction is to invent new ways of assessing creative \\nthinking and problem solving. \\nI Problems with Traditional Approaches to Instruction \\nAn increasing number of educators believe that typical instructional prac \\xad\\ntice fails to help students acquire knowledge in a form that facilitates \\nthinking and problem solving. They argue that most instruction is based \\non an antiquated \"transmission model\" by which teachers and authors \\nattempt to directly transmit their expertise to students . With the trans\\xad\\nmission model, instruction is usually decontextualized ; that is, it takes \\nplace outside the context of problems that actually require the use of the \\nknowledge gained. \\nResearchers have identified a number of problems with instruction \\nthat is based on the transmission model. For example, Charles Gragg 3 \\nargues that the basic problem is that \"wisdom can\\'t be told.\" The ability \\nto hear or read transmitted information and to remember it later is no \\nguarantee that people can use that knowledge to identify, define, and \\nsolve problems . In Chapter 7 we discussed Alfred North Whitehead \\'s \\npoint that our educational system was adept at producing inert know\\xad\\nledge-knowledge that people can recall but cannot apply to problems. \\nThis idea has been explored and expanded over the past 2 5 years. For \\nexample, Nobel laureate Herbert Simon has argued that a student\\'s fa\\xad\\nmiliarity with basic facts and isolated skills is not sufficient to support \\neffective problem solving . Such a familiarity provides no guarantee that '),\n",

He \\nnotes that \"students may possess calculus skills without recognizing that \\nthey are applicable to a particular physics problem or without knowing \\nexactly how to apply them.\" 4 \\nRn Example of Inert Hnowledge \\nA story related to us by a colleague, Ann Michael, illustrates the problem \\nof inert knowledge. 5 She served for several years as a clinical supervisor \\nof college students who were beginning a practicum in language therapy \\nfor language-delayed children. The students had all passed the required \\ncollege course on theories of language and their implications for therapy, \\nbut there was almost no evidence that the students ever attempted to use \\nthis knowledge in the clinical therapy sessions . Michael concluded that \\nthe college course must have been very poorly taught. \\nMichael was later asked to teach that college course herself. She did \\nwhat she thought was a highly competent job and was pleased with the \\ngeneral performance of the students on her tests. A year later, she en\\xad\\ncountered a number of her students again in the clinical practicum on \\nlanguage therapy. Much to her surprise and dismay, these students also \\nshowed almost no evidence of applying anything they had learned in \\ntheir language course . Many could remember facts when explicitly asked \\nabout them, but they did not automatically draw on that knowledge to \\nhelp them solve problems in the clinic. \\nMichael was reluctant to conclude that her college students per\\xad\\nformed poorly because of poor instruction. Instead she was motivated to \\nexplore problems with traditional approaches to instruction and to study \\nways to overcome them . Overall, Michael\\'s experiences confirmed \\nWhitehead\\'s, Gragg\\'s, and Simon\\'s observations that much of the infor\\xad\\nmation acquired in school tends to remain inert. \\nUses of Applications Problems to Teach Problem Solving \\nOf course, helping people to develop usable (that is, noninert) knowledge \\nby having them solve problems is not new. A time-honored approach is \\nto present students with applications problems such as those that appear \\nfollowing chapters in textbooks. The general approach is first to teach \\nstudents relevant skills and knowledge and then to let them see how this \\nknowledge can be applied. If you were teaching the concept of density, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 207}, page_content='In s truction That Facilitate s Problem Solving liB \\nfor example, you might first present the relevant facts and formulas (for \\ne x ample , that density equal s mass divided by volume) and then present \\napplications problems for solution (for example, \" An object weighs 4 \\ngrams and has a volume of 8 cubic centimeters . What is its density? \" ). \\nIt seems clear that the effectiveness of the transmission model of \\ninstruction can be improved by using applications problems . However , \\ntraditional applications problems have severe shortcomings . Researchers \\nin the Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt University have \\ndiscussed several of these shortcomings . 6 One is that they often fail to \\nhelp students think about realistic situations. Instead of bringing real \\xad\\nworld standards to their work, students tend to treat word problems \\nmechanically, failing to consider constraints imposed by real-world fac\\xad\\ntors . Ed Silver 7 provide s an excellent example of a relatively mechanical \\napproach to word problems . Students were asked to determine the num\\xad\\nber of buses needed to take a specific number of people on a field trip . \\nMany of them divided the total number of students by the number that \\neach bus would hold and came up with answers like 2V3. The students \\nfailed to consider that one cannot use a third of a bus . \\nA second limitation of traditional applications problems is the habits \\nof mind that they encourage . Applications problems can generally be \\nsolved by thinking back to information studied in the previous chapter or \\nchapters. The goal is therefore to retrieve information rather than to \\ndevelop a more intuitive and creative approach to problem solving . This \\ncan limit the development of people\\'s ability to think for themselves. \\nFurthermore, many applications problems provide only one correct an\\xad\\nswer to a problem. This can lead to misconceptions about the nature of \\nproblem solving and can inhibit creative thought. \\nA third limitation of traditional applications problems is that most of \\nthem explicitly define the problem to be solved rather than help students \\nto identify the problem themselves and work through the process of \\nclarifying their goals . Outside of schooL people have to identify problems \\nthat others have ignored and deal with problems that are not clearly \\ndefined. For example, consider the problem of preventing people from \\ngetting injured in automobile crashes that was discussed earlier. Effective \\nproblem solvers will define their goals in a variety of ways (for example, \\nto reduce injuries caused by people striking against hard objects inside \\nthe car, to create a system that absorbs the force of impact, or to prevent \\ncrashes from happening). Realistic problems can usually be approached \\nfrom a number of different perspectives and usually have a number of \\npotential solutions . It is therefore important to develop the skills neces-'),\n",

Indeed, we use them throughout this book to provide extra \\npractice in when, why, and how to apply the concepts discussed. Our \\nargument is that the general procedure of facts and principles first, fol\\xad\\nlowed by applications is not sufficient to develop powerful mental habits \\nthat support thinking and problem solving. Alternatives to this approach \\nare discussed next. \\nI Organizing ~earning Around Problem Solving \\nIn recent years, an increasing number of investigators have become inter\\xad\\nested in approaches to instruction that provide opportunities for students \\nto acquire relevant knowledge in the context of attempting to solve complex, \\nauthentic problems . This is not a new idea. For example, theorists such as \\nJohn Dewey and Norwood Hanson have noted that one reason experts \\ncan appreciate the potential value of new theories and concepts is that \\nsuch information has implications for problems about which they are \\ngenuinely interested .8 Consequently, experts are easily made aware of \\nhow new ideas produce changes in their own thinking. To novices, how\\xad\\never, new theories often seem to be made up of arbitrary relationships \\nand mechanical procedures that have to be memorized. Since novices \\nhave not been immersed in the phenomena being investigated, they \\ncannot gauge how a new way of thinking may change the way problems \\nare seen and understood. One of the major goals of situating or anchor\\xad\\ning instruction in problem-solving environments is to help students ap\\xad\\npreciate the problems and opportunities that experts encounter and to \\nexperience the changes in thinking that result from new concepts and \\nideas. \\nJohn Seeley Brown, Alan Collins, and Paul Duguid 9 discuss other \\nreasons for situating instruction in authentic problem-solving environ\\xad\\nments. They note that when students begin with authentic problems, \\nthey are more motivated to find solutions. In addition, this method helps \\nstudents to identify issues and opportunities and to see the need for \\nlearning about new concepts and procedures relevant to solving prob\\xad\\nlems. The importance of creating opportunities for students to become \\naware of the need for new concepts was also stressed by Alfred North \\nWhitehead, who argued that the first thing we should do with a new idea \\nis prove its worth by showing why it is particularly useful. \"),\n",

Many would write Bob off as \\nhaving a low aptitude for learning. But when you look at what Bob is \\ncapable of achieving outside of school, you get a very different impression \\nof his abilities. \\nPart of the soliloquy describes how teachers don\\'t like Bob because \\nhe doesn\\'t read the kind of books that they value. Bob\\'s favorite books \\ninclude Popular Science, the Mechanical Encyclopedia, and the Sear\\'s and \\nWard\\'s catalogs. Bob uses his books to pursue meaningful goals . He says, \\n\"I don\\'t just sit down and read them through like they make us do in \\nschool. I use my books when I want to find something out, like whenever \\nMom buys anything second hand I look it up in Sear\\'s or Ward\\'s first and \\ntell her if she\\'s getting stung or not.\" \\nLater on, Bob explains the trouble he had memorizing the names of \\nthe presidents. He knew some of them, like Washington and Jefferson, \\nbut there were 30 altogether and he never did get them all straight. He \\nseems to have a poor memory. Then he talks about the three trucks his \\nuncle owns and how he knows the horsepower and number of forward \\nand backward gears of 26 different American trucks, many of them die\\xad\\nsels. Then he says, \"It\\'s funny how that Diesel works. I started to tell my \\nteacher about it last Wednesday in science class when the pump we were \\nusing to make a vacuum in a bell jar got hot, but she said she didn\\'t see \\nwhat a Diesel engine had to do with our experiment on air pressure so I \\njust kept still. The kids seemed interested, though.\" \\nBob also discusses his inability to do the kinds of word problems \\nfound in his textbooks. Yet he helps his uncle make all kinds of complex \\nplans when they travel together . He talks about the bills and letters he \\nsends to the farmers whose livestock his uncle hauls and about how he \\nmade only three mistakes in his last 17 letters-all of them commas . \\nThen he says , \"I wish I could write school themes that way. The last one \\nI had to write was on \\'What a Daffodil Thinks of Spring,\\' and I just \\ncouldn\\'t get going.\" \\nBob ends his soliloquy by noting that, according to his dad, he can \\nquit school at the age of 15, and he feels like he should.

We discuss several examples be low. \\nCase - Based Instruction \\nA number of professional schools such as law schools, medical schools, \\nbusiness schools, and schools of educational administration are using an \\napproach called \"case-based\" or \"problem-based\" instruction. Susan Wil\\xad\\nliams11 provides an excellent review and analysis of case-based instruc\\xad\\ntion in law schools and medical schools. The essence of the approach is to \\norganize instruction around actual situations that students are likely to \\nencounter later in their careers. In business, for example, a case might \\nfocus on a company that is in trouble and needs to be restructured. In \\nmedicine, a case might involve a patient with certain symptoms . Students \\nwork on cases over some fixed period of time, acquire any new informa\\xad\\ntion that is needed to so lve the problem, and eventully discuss their ideas \\nwith classmates and with the professor. Idea ll y, students move from sim\\xad\\nple cases to more complex ones. In the process , they acquire relevant \\nknowledge while learning to ana lyze prob lems, set learning goa ls, and \\npresent and discuss their ideas. \\nThere are a wide variety of ideas about what makes a good case and \\nwhat the best way is to use cases. Williams notes that the cases used in \\nlaw schools tend to be quite different in structure from those used in \\nmedical schools. In addition, there are a variety of case forma t s within \\nany particular area. For example, one format for a medica l case is to \\nprovide data about a patient\\'s symptoms and test res u lts and then have \\nstudents make a diagnosis. Another format is for a simulated patient to \\nanswer questions posed by students. This encourages questions from the \\nstudents that are quite similar to those that practicing physicians will \\nhave to ask after they leave school. \\nMost variations on case-based and pro bl em-based learning provide \\nopportunities to develop effective problem-solving skills like those in the '),\n",

For example, students learn to identify problems and \\nopportunities in the context of the cases, to define goals (such as to ac\\xad\\nquire information relevant to a case), to explore strategies (such as where \\nto look for information .or what tests to perform), to anticipate the effec\\xad\\ntiveness of their current level of analysis , and eventually to act by pre\\xad\\nsenting their ideas to the teacher and fellow classmates. This provides an \\nopportunity for them to look at the effects of their actions and to learn \\nsomething that will help them solve the next case. \\nProject - Based Instruction \\nAnother way to organize instruction around problem solving is to create \\nstudent projects. An excellent example is the Discover Rochester project \\ndiscussed by Alan Collins, Jan Hawkins, and Sharon Carver . 12 In this \\nproject, eighth-grade students who were at risk of dropping out of school \\nspent one day each week exploring aspects of their hometown-Roch\\xad\\nester, New York-from a scientific, mathematical, historical, cultural, and \\nliterary perspective . Working in groups, the students conducted their \\nown research on topics such as industry , weather, theater, and employ\\xad\\nment. On the basis of their research, they developed multimedia exhibits \\nfor the Rochester Museum and Science Center. The exhibits included \\ntext, audio , graphics, maps , and music. Students also studied the reac\\xad\\ntions of people to their projects and refined them based on the feedback \\nthey received. \\nCollins, Hawkins, and Carver used a variation of the IDEAL frame\\xad\\nwork adapted to their project. They helped students identify problems and \\nopportunities by encouraging them to pose interesting questions about \\ntheir community. As students researched the answers to these questions, \\nthey were helped to further define their goals. They were then helped to \\nexplore a number of strategies for gathering and representing data, includ\\xad\\ning strategies for using indexes, conducting interviews, and organizing \\nand analyzing data . Students then attempted to anticipate the effects of \\ntheir presentations (for example, by conducting tests with one another), \\nand they eventually acted on their ideas by placing their multimedia \\nproducts in the museum. Students were then encouraged to look at the \\neffects of their products on the audience and to learn from the experi\\xad\\nence. Some students learned that their products were less interesting \\nthan they had thought; they therefore reentered the IDEAL cycle in order \\nto improve the product the next time . \\nMany teachers in other fields have effectively used projects as an\\xad\\nchors for instruction. For example, Lisa Glick and Michael Ross used the '),\n",

Teachers in business and economics have \\ntried to anchor instruction in realistic problems such as establishing and \\nmaintaining a small business. Working on such problems makes it much \\neasier for students to understand the need for accurate accounting proce\\xad\\ndures, principles of finance, and concepts of business management. \\nOther real-world problems that can serve as effective anchors for \\ninstruction may be narrower in scope than establishing and maintaining \\na new business. For example, we have explored with Bob Harwood such \\nproblems as determining what types of nails are hardest to remove from \\nwood and what type of lubricant is best for a model race car. 14 These \\nproblems can serve as effective anchors for concepts in physics, chem\\xad\\nistry, and the scientific method. \\nSome complex real-world problems, such as designing a better way \\nto protect people from injury in automobile accidents, can be simplified \\nand explored with the limited equipment and materials available in the \\nclassroom. For example, we have worked with teachers like Tony Pet\\xad\\nrosino , who asked his students to design an enclosure that would protect \\nan egg from breaking after it was dropped from a second -story window. \\nThis problem has been used by many educators as an effective anchor for \\nhelping students learn about physics and the scientific method . \\nDebates as Anchors tor Learning \\nDebates are often used in our society as a medium for communicating \\nideas and influencing attitudes, and they can also be used as effective \\nanchors for learning . To effectively debate an issue, students must spend \\nconsiderable time searching for and analyzing information about the \\nunderlying issues . The structure of a debate provides more clearly de\\xad\\nfined goals for this new information than students might otherwise have. \\nFor example, to prepare for a debate on the issue of national health \\ninsurance, it is important to understand both sides of the issue and to \\nprepare an effective counterargument for each claim the opponent might \\nmake. Instead of being isolated facts, information about the cost and \\neffectiveness of health care programs in other countries becomes sig\\xad\\nnificant and relevant to defending a particular position. The goals that the \\nparticipants pursue in preparing for the debate help them to understand '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 213}, page_content='In s tru c tion That Facilitates Problem Solving E1tl \\nthe potential value of new information and to place that new information \\nunder close scrutiny. \\nDebate topics can be formulated in almost any field. It is important \\nto select a topic that students have some familiarity with but that can \\nserve as an anchor for the sustained exploration of new concepts and \\nideas. For example, topics involving environmental issues such as recy\\xad\\ncling and incineration can provide a meaningful anchor for learning \\na b out chemical reactions, biological processes, and the ecosystem. The \\ninstructor can influence the topics explored in these debates by providing \\nrelevant readings or sources of information and by establishing criteria \\nfor evaluating the adequacy of arguments (for example, the presentation \\nmust include an adequate chemical analysis of the products of incinera\\xad\\ntion). \\nAlternatives to Traditional Debates \\nOne of the problems with traditional debates is that they usually take \\nplace during a short period of time . Even though the participants may \\nhave considerable time to prepare for the debate, they often have little \\ntime to communicate their positions and to prepare counterarguments \\nagainst their opponents. The traditional debate format allows little oppor\\xad\\ntunity for sustained exploration of topics once the debate is over. \\nWe have experimented with alternative debate formats that permit \\nmore sustained exploration and give students input into the debate pro\\xad\\ncess. One format that seems particularly promising is the \"challenge de\\xad\\nbate .\" This differs from the traditional debate in that each group of stu\\xad\\ndents presents its argument at different times. For example, one group \\nmay prepare its argument in response to a television program or current \\nevent. Its presentation is presented to the class and recorded, giving the \\nother students a record of the presentations and a chance to carefully \\nexamine the argument. Successive groups of students then prepare argu\\xad\\nments that challenge this presentation . The ongoing nature of these chal\\xad\\nlenge debates gives each group of students the opportunity for sustained \\nexploration of the issue as the debate progresses. An additional advantage \\nof recording each presentation is that students can compare their argu\\xad\\nments to those in other classes. \\nVideo - Based Anchor s o r Macrocontexts \\nAnother approach to problem-based instruction involves the use of video \\nand computer technology to anchor or situate instruction within the '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 214}, page_content='11m1 R Model tor Requiring New Knowledge \\ncontext of meaningful problems . One example of a video-based anchor is \\nthe \"Voyage of the Mimi\" program developed at Bank Street College. It \\nprovides a series of exciting video stories about a group of students who \\ngo on a sailing trip to study whales. After watching the video, students \\n(from the fifth grade and up) engage in paper - and-pencil and computer\\xad\\nbased problem-solving activities that allow them to explore the useful\\xad\\nness of a variety of scientific and mathematical concepts . 15 \\nAnother example of a video-based anchor for instruction is Vander\\xad\\nbilt University\\'s Jasper Woodbury Problem Solving Series designed for \\nstudents in the fifth grade and up . There are currently six adventures in \\nthe Jasper series. Two use stories that involve complex trip planning, two \\nrequire the use of statistics to create and present a feasible business plan, \\nand two use geometry to estimate heights and navigate. Each adventure \\nin the series ends with an interesting, complex problem to solve; students \\ngenerate the subgoals necessary to solve the problem and can then look \\nback at the video to find relevant data embedded in the story. Each \\nadventure also provides opportunities to integrate information from a \\nvariety of disciplines such as history, geography, literature, and science. \\nIn the Jasper adventure \"Rescue at Boone\\'s Meadow,\" an ultralight \\nairplane must be used to rescue a wounded eagle in a remote location . \\nStudents must help plan the rescue, and to do so they must search for \\nrelevant information that was presented earlier in the story . For example, \\nthey need data about the speed, fuel consumption, and fuel capacity of \\nthe ultralight ; the location of the eagle; possible landing sites; areas where \\nthere are and are not roads; the weight of eagles; and needed supplies. In \\nmost classes, each Jasper problem takes from three to five class periods to \\nsolve. Students then work on \"what if\" problems that encourage them to \\nexpand their thinking about each adventure. For example, the original \\nrescue was on a calm day , but what if there had been a 5-rnile-per-hour \\nheadwind? As students work through this problem they discover the \\nneed to dramatically revise the original rescue plan. \\nThe Jasper series is on videodisc rather than videotape, making it \\neasier to search for relevant data . The Jasper series has been shown to \\nenhance complex problem-solving skills and to improve attitudes toward \\nmathematics . 16 \\nSimulations \\nSimulations provide another way to situate learning within the context \\nof meaningful problems. Advances in microcomputer technology have '),\n",

For example, the computer pro\\xad\\ngram SimCity allows one to design and manage a model city . Users can \\ncontrol development (for example, commercial, residential, industrial, \\nand transportation); set taxes; and monitor important indices such as \\npublic opinion, population growth, tax revenue, government expendi\\xad\\ntures, and property values. The simulation provides the opportunity to \\nidentify problems such as inadequate fire and police protection and to \\nexperience the effects of failing to deal with those problems. It allows \\nusers to define goals for their city (such as reliance on mass transporta\\xad\\ntion versus the automobile, or controlled growth versus rapid expan\\xad\\nsion) and to explore a variety of strategies for achieving those goals. In \\naddition, they can antidpate potential problems such as earthquakes and \\nexplore strategies that might mitigate their consequences (building re\\xad\\ndundancy into the electric power distribution network, for example). \\nSimulations also allow people to act on their strategies and look back at \\nthe effects, something that can be difficult and costly to do in the real \\nworld. \\nSimCity can serve as an effective anchor for learning about the \\neffects of tax rates on economic expansion and the design of effective \\ntransportation systems. Other simulations, such as SimEarth, can provide \\nan anchor for learning about biology and earth sciences. 17 \\nA potential problem with simulations like SimCity is the degree to \\nwhich they distort, simplify, or ignore variables that may have important \\neffects in real life. For example, SimCity does not deal with waste dis\\xad\\nposal, an important problem in modern cities. It also does not permit \\nusers to select specific industries for development, which would encour\\xad\\nage consideration of such important factors as their environmental im\\xad\\npact and wage level s. In addition, the cost of developing new properties \\nin the simulation is not realistic, and the mathematical models that un\\xad\\nderlie the simulated effects of tax rates on economic activity are over\\xad\\nsimplified. Given the complexity of the problems that programs like \\nSimCity and SirnEarth are designed to explore, however, we cannot fault \\nthe developers for simplifying the underlying model. \\nTo determine whether a simulation can serve as an effective anchor \\nfor instruction, it is necessary to carefully define the goals for problem\\xad\\nbased learning and see if the simulation allows students to explore vari\\xad\\nables that are relevant to those goals. Ideally, the developers of simulation \\npackages will work with educators to create programs that support a \\nvariety of educational goals. '),\n",

We have seen many attempts to use problem-based learning \\nfail because insufficient consideration was given to key components of \\nthe instructional context. For instance, problem-based instruction can fail \\nbecause the problems themselves are not interesting to students or be\\xad\\ncause they are presented in a way that does not challenge or motivate \\nstudents. We believe that almost any problem can be made into a chal\\xad\\nlenging and motivating experience. Doing so requires many of the com\\xad\\nmunication skills discussed in Chapter 5, especially those concerned with \\nunderstanding the intended audience. \\nIt is easy to present a problem that is insufficiently challenging, but \\nit is also possible to present one that is too difficult for students to work \\nwith in a productive way. It is important to provide sufficient instruction\\xad\\nal support that students are not overwhelmed by a task. It is also a good \\nidea to select problems that build upon knowledge acquired from pre\\xad\\nvious learning experiences. \\nProblem-based instruction may also fail when the structure of the \\nproblem or the problem-solving environment is insufficient to perrnit the \\nestablishment of meaningful goals and the exploration of productive \\nstrategies. For example, earlier in this book we discussed the problem of \\nlong lines at grocery stores. We have found with this problem that it is \\nimportant to impose realistic constraints on the solution (for example, \\nthat it must be cost effective and not cause the store to lose money). \\nWithout such constraints students are free to explore unproductive strat\\xad\\negies (such as not admitting new customers or building another store \\nnearby) that would not be feasible in real life. It is therefore important to \\nimpose constraints that encourage the use of relevant resources and the \\nexploration of productive strategies. Of course, it is also possible to im\\xad\\npose too many constraints on the problem-solving process, which can \\nprevent people from exploring creative alternatives . \\nFinally, problem-based instruction can fail when students are not \\nhelped to take a systematic approach to problem solving and to carefully \\nevaluate their actions. For many students, problem-based learning is a \\nnew experience, and they may be unprepared for a situation in which \\ngoals are not clearly defined and the strategies needed to solve problems \\nare not readily apparent . We have found that prompting students to '),\n",

An especially important considera \\xad\\ntion is the need to design opportunities for assessment. We discuss this \\nissue later in the chapter . \\nProblem Selection \\nAnchoring instruction in realistic problem-solving tasks works best when \\nthese tasks are tailored to the needs, interests, and skills of students. \\nIdeally, instructors interested in problem-based learning should find or \\ndevelop their own anchors or find ways to help students design problems \\nfor themselves. \\nThe process of developing effective problems can be facilitated by \\nusing the IDEAL framework. For example, one of our colleagues in the \\nsocial sciences , Ada Haynes, identified a problem in her students' under\\xad\\nstanding of the concept of prejudice. Although many of them could recite \\na definition of the word, few could recognize many instances of prejudice \\nin their environment. Rather than give a lecture on the topic , Haynes \\ntreated the problem as an opportunity to provide a learning experience \\nthat would promote greater understanding and recognition of prejudice . \\nShe defined her goal as teaching students to recognize prejudice in others \\nthrough the irrational behavior that it promotes . She also wanted stu \\xad\\ndents to learn to recognize prejudice in themselves . To accomplish these \\ngoals, she explored realistic situations in which decisions could be based \\neither on reason or on prejudice. \\nOne task required students to decide who should be let into a special \\nshelter during a nuclear war. Students were told that the 6 people chosen \\nmight be the only ones left on the planet and that they would have to \\nchoose these 6 out of a list of 12 . They were given information about the \\n12 people that might be relevant to the goal of rebuilding society (for \\nexample, fertility, medical training, and agricultural training) . In addi\\xad\\ntion, some of the individuals were assigned characteristics that typically \\ninvoke prejudice (being Jewish, African-American, socialist, or Iraqi) . \\nShe tried to antidpate the effectiveness of her strategy by finding out \\nbeforehand which cultural or ethnic groups elicited the strongest signs of \\nprejudice . \\nHaynes acted on her instructional strategy by having students make \\nand explain their decisions . She then was able to look back at the effec\\xad\\ntiveness of her strategy and to learn how to make improvements .

Early advocates of cooperative learning include such \\ntheorists and practitioners as Francis Parker, John Dewey, Margaret \\nMead, and Morton Deutsch. Dewey argued that classroom life should \\nembody the ideals of a democratic society. He felt that an important part \\nof that ideal was that people work together to solve common problems. 19 \\nMore recently, educational researchers such as Elliot Aronson, David \\nJohnson, Roger Johnson, and Robert Slavin have advocated the use of \\ncooperative learning procedures. 20 \\nMuch of the problem-based learning discussed earlier in this chap\\xad\\nter can be used in conjunction with cooperative learning groups. Indeed, \\nmany of the problem-based methods we described work best when stu\\xad\\ndents work together in small learning groups. One advantage of combin\\xad\\ning cooperative learning with problem-based instruction is that it allows \\nstudents to deal with more complex and time-consuming problems than \\nthey would be able to work with on their own. For example, a complex \\nproblem can be broken down into parts and the tasks divided among \\ngroup members. Each student has his or her individual tasks to perform \\nbut also helps others when problems arise. Encouraging students to help \\none another reduces their dependence on the instructor and permits \\nthem to explore more creative approaches to problems. We have found \\nthat the IDEAL framework can facilitate cooperative learning during \\nproblem solving. \\nUnfortunately, we have also seen cases in which cooperative learn\\xad\\ning did not allow the majority of students to accomplish the learning \\ngoals we felt were important. Less able members of the group often let \\nothers do all the work (this is sometimes called \"social loafing\") or else \\nthose with the most ability did all the work. David Johnson and Roger \\nJohnson 21 provide a variety of useful guidelines for developing coopera\\xad\\ntive learning environments that avoid these problems. For instance, they \\nargue that it is important to create a learning environment in which \\nstudents have a vested interest in promoting one another\\'s success and \\neach group member is understood to have a unique and indispensable \\ncontribution to make to the group\\'s effort. In addition, it is important to \\nensure that each individual be accountable for the group\\'s work as well \\nas his or her own. These goals can be furthered by having each student\\'s '),\n",

We have also found it helpful for students to evaluate \\none another\\'s performance. \\nI The Importance of Opportunities for Assessment \\nThroughout this book we have emphasized the importance of the look \\nand learn components of the IDEAL framework . For example, in Chapter \\n7 we discussed the importance of debugging learning strategies by look\\xad\\ning at one\\'s performance in various situations such as exams. If we fail to \\nlook at the effects of our actions (for example, of our study strategies) we \\ncannot learn from them. Effective instruction requires frequent oppor\\xad\\ntunities for students to analyze the effects of their actions and to learn \\nfrom them . \\nMany years ago the noted psychologist Edward Thorndike per\\xad\\nformed a simple experiment that illustrates the importance of learning \\nfrom the effects of one\\'s actions. 22 He defined his goal as learning to draw \\na line while blindfolded that was exactly 4 inches long. He practiced \\nhundreds of times-blindfolded-and never improved. Because of the \\nblindfold he could never look at the effects of his actions, so he never \\nknew the length of the line he had just drawn. Eventually Thorndike \\nremoved the blindfold and was able to see how close each line he drew \\ncame to 4 inches. He quickly mastered his goal. The purpose of the \\nexperiment was to demonstrate the role of feedback in learning. Removal \\nof the blindfold allowed Thorndike to receive feedback; that is, to look at \\nthe effects of his actions and learn from them. \\nWe noted in Chapter 7 that people often fail to analyze the effects of \\ntheir activities . They act as if they were blindfolded-or if they do look it \\nis not in enough detail. For example, we discussed the fact that many \\nstudents note only their overall grade on an exam or paper, failing to \\nidentify the kinds of questions they missed and to understand why. \\nSeeing only one\\'s grade on a test is like being blindfolded, attempting to \\ndraw a line exactly 4 inches long, and then being told \"right\" or \"wrong.\" \\nThis may help to some extent, but it is better to have more precise \\ninformation about the effects of one\\'s actions. The statement \"It\\'s 1!2 inch \\ntoo long\" is more helpful than \"It\\'s too long,\" which in tum is more \\nhelpful than \"It\\'s wrong.\" \\nIn educational settings, both teachers and students can benefit by \\nlooking at the effects of their actions and learning from them. Students \\ncan learn to learn by analyzing the reasons for their performance on tests '),\n",

Teachers can \\nlearn to improve their own instruction by looking at its effects on student \\nlearning . If students are doing poorly, chances are that many elements of \\nthe instruction could be improved. \\nTests Versus Opportunities tor Self - Rssessment \\nIt is important to distinguish \"testing\" from \"opportunities for self-assess\\xad\\nment.\" Students are often tested in ways that do not help them learn to \\nlearn. On an essay exam or a paper, for example, students may receive a \\nletter grade but never have an opportunity to explore with the instructor \\nhow their learning and writing strategies could be improved. \\nOne reason instructors are more likely to give tests than oppor\\xad\\ntunities for self-assessment is that their time is limited. It can be very \\ndifficult to find the time to work one-on-one-especially with large clas\\xad\\nses of students-but there are a variety of strategies that can be used to \\nhelp students learn from essay exams and other written assignments. 23 \\nSome of these provide opportunities for revising an exam or paper before \\nthe final grade is assigned . For example, we have found it very beneficial \\nto have students provide detailed criticism and feedback (peer review) \\nabout one another\\'s writing. Another strategy useful with college stu\\xad\\ndents is to provide anonymous examples of outstanding answers to each \\nessay question when tests are returned. This lets each student compare \\nan example of excellent performance to his or her own performance on \\nthe same question. We also attempt to help students analyze the ele\\xad\\nments that make up an excellent answer . A variation on this procedure is \\nto provide students with anonymous examples of excellent, good, and \\naverage essay answers so that they have a larger set for comparison. In \\nour experience, students can readily see the difference between excel\\xad\\nlent, good, and average performance; in the process, they develop better \\ncriteria for judging their own performance on future tests . \\nThe Nature of Rssessments \\nIf our goal is to help students learn to solve problems and become inde\\xad\\npendent learners, assessment is crucial. We have noted throughout this \\nbook that different learning goals require different learning strategies. If \\nexams test only a few important learning goals, students will adapt their \\ngoals to the tests and learn only a few strategies for learning. \\nEducators and researchers like Joan Baron argue that schools will \\nnot be able to convert to a problem-solving curriculum until they change '),\n",

These are \\nimportant to know and to test, but if they are all that we test, we are not \\nhelping students to think and learn on their own. For example, imagine \\ntrying to implement one of the problem-based curricula discussed earlier \\nby administering frequent tests of the facts in the curriculum. Effective \\nlearners would get better at memorizing facts, but this would be no \\nguarantee that they would learn to find, define, and solve problems on \\ntheir own . \\nA challenge facing all educators is to find ways of assessing learning \\nthat focus on authentic performances that are relevant to society and the \\nworkplace. Examples might include gathering data for a convincing busi\\xad\\nness plan; working on a team to create interesting and informative edu\\xad\\ncational products; presenting a coherent argument both in writing and \\norally and then answering questions; or designing a device that performs \\na useful function. The important point is that the overall goal requires \\nthat the student engage in a set of authentic performances rather than \\nmerely memorizing disconnected facts and procedures. As learning goals \\nbecome more authentic, students begin to find and invent strategies that \\nwill be useful throughout their lives. \\nWe want to emphasize, however, that more is involved in authentic \\nassessment than a focus on authentic goals. We have seen many class\\xad\\nroom implementations of problem-based curricula such as those dis\\xad\\ncussed earlier in this chapter that do not provide opportunities for self\\xad\\nassessment as the project proceeds. Often the only assessment is at the \\nend of the project, when students turn in their finished product. It is \\nmuch more valuable for students to have opportunities for reflection and \\ndiscussion at all stages of a project. For example, students can be helped \\nto assess the reasonableness of all aspects of problem solving-their iden\\xad\\ntification of interesting topics; their ability to define alternative goals, in\\xad\\ncluding learning goals; their exploration of strategies for achieving these \\ngoals; their ability to anticipate the effects of their actions; and their ability \\nto look at the effects of those actions and learn from them. \\nI Summar~ \\nIn this chapter we discussed the importance of preparing people to think \\nfor themselves and solve problems so that they can adapt to a world that \\nis changing at an increasingly rapid pace. There are several reasons that \\nour educational system may not be preparing people for these goals. For '),\n",

The ability to remember transmitted information is \\noften insufficient to ensure the ability to use that knowledge to identify, \\ndefine, and solve problems. \\nA variety of instructional strategies might help people to develop \\nusable (that is, noninert) knowledge and thinking skills. One traditional \\napproach to achieving these goals are the applications problems that \\nappear at the end of chapters in textbooks . Although the effectiveness of \\nthe transmission model can be improved by the use of applications prob\\xad\\nlems, they have several shortcomings. One is that applications problems \\noften fail to help students think about realistic situations and to develop \\nthe thinking skills that are important for solving realistic problems-skills \\nsuch as identifying problems that others have ignored and working with \\nproblems that are not dearly defined. \\nAlternative approaches to instruction situate or anchor learning in \\nmore realistic problem-solving environments. These problem-based ap\\xad\\nproaches include a variety of strategies for anchoring instruction in realis\\xad\\ntic problems. Some problem-based approaches involve the use of new \\ntechnologies such as videodisc workstations to present real-life dramas . \\nIn contrast , other forms of problem-based learning involve little or no \\ntechnology and instead use methods such as debates. \\nThere are many problems that can serve as anchors for instruction, \\nbut selecting appropriate ones requires careful analysis of the desired \\ngoals for learning and the skills and interests of the students. \\nThe use of problem-based instruction requires alternative ways of \\nassessing student performance . If we are truly interested in developing \\nmore complex thinking skills, we cannot rely on tests that assess only the \\nability to remember facts and procedures. Many problem-based curricula \\ndo not provide opportunities for self-assessment as students progress \\nthrough a project but instead focus only on the final product. Without \\nsystematic assessment, both learning and teaching are usually far less \\nthan ideal. \\nIn this chapter we emphasized the importance of making learning a \\npart of some larger goal-directed activity in which new information be\\xad\\ncomes a valuable tool or strategy . Even the best problem or new technol\\xad\\nogy will have little effect on learning if students are forced to be passive \\nrecipients of information .

To accomplish this goal, we must become \\nmore aware of the variety of problems we face in our everyday lives and \\nof the processes we use in attempting to find creative solutions . This is \\nwhy we discussed the IDEAL model of problem solving and illustrated \\nhow it is applicable to many types of problems . \\nBecoming more aware of the processes underlying problem solving \\ndoes not necessarily mean always thinking in detail about these processes \\nwhile attempting to solve problems. If you spend all your time analyzing \\nyour thinking processes, you will probably find that it interferes with \\nyour ability to solve problems (try to tie your shoe or drive a car while \\nconsciously analyzing each step). Awareness of the processes that under\\xad\\nlie problem solving becomes most valuable when you are dealing with \\nnonroutine problems . If you are observant, you can often catch yourself \\nfailing to ( l) identify potential problems and opportunities, ( 2) define al\\xad\\nternative goals, ( 3) explore a variety of possible approaches, ( 4) anticipate \\noutcomes and act on your ideas, or (5) look at the effects of your actions \\nand learn. By becoming aware of these components of problem solving, \\nyou will have a much better chance of approaching problems in optimal \\nways . '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 228}, page_content=\"IIDI T he Ideal Problem Solver \\nI The Development of Problem - Solving S~ills \\nOne of our major themes has been that the improvement of problem\\xad\\nsolving skills is an ongoing process. By using the IDEAL model you can \\nbecome more aware of the processes involved in identifying opportu\\xad\\nnities and solving problems, which can improve your ability to notice \\npossibilities for improvement. We have tried to show how the IDEAL \\nmodel provides a framework for enhancing the way we think about a \\nwide variety of problems. In the first part of the book we discussed how \\nthe IDEAL framework can help us use existing knowledge more effec\\xad\\ntively to solve problems, and in the second part we discussed how the \\nIDEAL framework can help us learn new information. One of the most \\npowerful ways to increase our ability to solve problems is to acquire new \\nconceptual tools, which can often be very specialized . For instance, if you \\nwant to solve plumbing problems you should learn about the tools and \\nconcepts plumbers use to simplify their tasks. Similarly, improving your \\nability to solve other problems may require knowledge of biology, math\\xad\\nematics, or finance. It is particularly important to learn new information \\nwith understanding so that knowledge does not remain inert. \\nIn many formal educational settings it is sometimes difficult to see \\nhow concepts and procedures can be used as problem-solving tools. Stu\\xad\\ndents are often exposed to concepts without having a good idea of the \\ntypes of problems they were designed to solve. To be a successful learner, \\nit is important to identify problems and define goals relevant to the \\nknowledge you are attempting to master. An effective way to learn, \\ntherefore, is to become familiar with the activities pursued by those who \\nwork in the field you are studying; this can provide a context for more \\nformal types of study, such as learning from lectures and books. For \\nexample, experience with the everyday problems faced by business ex\\xad\\necutives can provide a context for understanding and evaluating books \\non management. If you have an idea of the kinds of problems faced by \\nexecutives, you will be in a much better position to determine whether \\nparticular books provide the kinds of conceptual tools executives need. \\nI Rttitudes \\nWe noted in the first chapter that one of the biggest stumbling blocks to \\nimproving problem solving can be negative attitudes about one's own \\nabilities. It is easy to tell people to think positively about their ability to \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 229}, page_content='Concluding Remarks IDII \\nsolve problems, but such a suggestion often has little effect on attitudes \\nacquired over many years of experience. A lack of confidence in our \\nability to solve problems can manifest itself in a variety of ways, including \\nlack of interest, fear of exploring new domains, and fear of criticism. \\nThese feelings can interfere with problem solving and can prevent us \\nfrom engaging in activities that might improve our problem-solving skills. \\nThe IDEAL approach can be especially helpful in these situations because \\nit provides a guide for debugging unsuccessful approaches. By identifying \\nthe attitudes that inhibit success and defining appropriate goals, we can \\nbegin to explore strategies that may stop us from repeating earlier fail\\xad\\nures. By actively using appropriate strategies, we can give ourselves the \\nopportunity to experience success and so build our self-confidence. \\nThe tendency to avoid new problems becomes especially strong \\nwhen others are performing well and we are experiencing considerable \\ndifficulty. In such situations, we often explain our difficulty by assuming \\nthat we are inept or slow and others are talented. An alternative perspec\\xad\\ntive is that everyone experiences difficulty when dealing with nonroutine \\nproblems or first learning about a new subject. We should not judge our \\nability to solve a nonroutine problem by comparing ourselves with those \\nwhose experience makes that same problem routine, or we may mis\\xad\\ntakenly underestimate our own abilities. As you continue to explore \\nsimilar problems in the same area of inquiry, you will find that they \\nbecome easier and easier to solve as they become more routine for you. \\nIn Chapter 6 we asked you to remember what it was like when you \\nwere first learning to drive a car. If you are like most people, you felt \\nextremely awkward. You probably had to think consciously about apply\\xad\\ning the brake, turning the wheel, using the turn signal, and so forth, and \\nit was difficult to do something like carry on a conversation while driving. \\nWith practice, however, many aspects of driving became automatic, and \\nsimultaneously driving and carrying on a conversation became routine. \\nIt is useful to keep the driving example in mind when you are trying \\nto learn new tasks because the experience will almost undoubtedly be \\nsimilar. At first, everything will seem overwhelming, and people who can \\nalready perform these tasks may seem almost superhuman . Later, you \\nwill perform them with little difficulty; they will become relatively rou\\xad\\ntine and require much less conscious attention. Nevertheless, to reach \\nthis stage you must be prepared to go through a period of awkwardness. \\nYou must have the courage to risk making mistakes. \\nThe problem of learning a second language provides an excellent \\nillustration of the importance of risk-taking. 1 Researchers have found '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'idealproblemsolver.pdf', 'page': 230}, page_content='IIJDI The Ideal Problem Solver \\nthat an important difference between successful and less successful sec\\xad\\nond-language learners is that the former will usually make a best guess \\nabout the meaning of an unfamiliar statement when they are not ab\\xad\\nsolutely sure of the answer . In contrast, less successful students often \\navoid taking such risks. Similarly, one of the reasons young children \\nlearn so readily seems to be that they are less self-conscious about mak\\xad\\ning errors .2 Of course, young children often do not realize that they have \\nmade an error (for example, in interpreting a statement), whereas adults \\nare more likely to do so. Nevertheless, to be effective problem solvers we \\nmust be willing to take the chance that we may not always be correct. \\nThe IDEAL problem solver realizes that problem solving is a self-correct\\xad\\ning activity that allows for improvement only if we are willing to act on \\nour best ideas. \\nI Notes \\nl.

The formula is 2 6 , for a total of \\n64 size 7 fish that must be eaten each day . \\nIncidentally, it is this progression in the food chain that \\nresults in \"biological magnification.\" Even a small percentage \\nof toxins in a lake can become much more concentrated in \\nlarger fish because they eat a large number of small fish each \\nday. \\n16. When the robot is seen in context, some of its design flaws be\\xad\\ncome more apparent. For example, its sponges are too big to \\nbe dipped into its head (the bucket).

The author of the column \"Ask Marilyn\" acknow\\xad\\nledged the mistake after a reader pointed it out in a letter . \\nMany people think that the problem states that a hen and a \\nhalf produce an egg and a half every day . They then figure \\nthat it will take one hen to produce six eggs in six days. The \\nproblem really states that it will take a day and a half for a \\nhen and a half to produce an egg and a half.

This is a problem that can be solved by working backward. \\nOn the last move of the game you want to be able to pick up \\n1 to 5 coins to win. To do that you have to leave your op\\xad\\nponent 6 coins on the preceding turn . To be able to leave 6 \\ncoins on the previous turn you must leave 12 coins on the \\nturn before that. The only way you can be certain of leaving \\n12 coins for your opponent is to make the first move and \\nremove 3 coins. Of course, if you are playing someone who is \\nnot aware of this strategy , it will be possible to win even if \\nyour opponent goes first, as long as he or she does not \\nremove 3 coins on the first turn . While this particular version \\nof Nim is played with 15 coins, other versions can be played \\nwith any number of coins , matches, or other small objects. \\nThe objects are grouped into any number of piles and players \\ncan remove all or part of a pile on each turn.

      "Bullying is a complex problem, and there's no single \"magic bullet\" solution. However, here are some strategies you can try, broken down into immediate actions, long-term strategies, and when to seek further help:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Actions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Ensure your safety:** If you feel physically threatened, remove yourself from the situation immediately and find a safe place, like a teacher's office or the library.\n",
      "* **Don't engage:**  Bullies often thrive on reactions.  Try your best to remain calm and avoid responding. This can be incredibly difficult, but it can sometimes disarm the bully.  If you can, walk away.\n",
      "* **Document everything:** Keep a record of each incident, including dates, times, locations, what happened, and who was involved. This documentation can be helpful if you need to report the bullying to school authorities.\n",
      "* **Confide in someone:** Talk to a trusted adult, such as a parent, teacher, counselor, or other school staff member.  Sharing your experience can provide emotional support and help you develop a plan to address the bullying.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Long-Term Strategies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Assertiveness training:** Learning assertive communication skills can help you stand up for yourself without being aggressive. This might involve using \"I\" statements to express your feelings and needs clearly and confidently.\n",
      "* **Build your support network:** Surround yourself with positive and supportive friends and family members. Having a strong social network can help you feel less isolated and more resilient to bullying.\n",
      "* **Focus on your strengths:**  Engage in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. This can help boost your self-esteem and make you less vulnerable to bullying.\n",
      "* **Practice self-care:**  Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. This might include getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and engaging in relaxing activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**When to Seek Further Help:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **If the bullying is severe or escalating:** If you feel physically threatened, or if the bullying is significantly impacting your mental health, it's important to seek professional help.\n",
      "* **If the school is not taking appropriate action:** If you have reported the bullying to the school and they are not taking steps to address it, you may need to involve higher authorities or consider other options.\n",
      "* **If you are struggling to cope:** If you are feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or depressed, it's important to reach out to a mental health professional. They can provide support and guidance to help you navigate this challenging situation.\n",
